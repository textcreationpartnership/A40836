            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> publiſhed this ancient Hiſtory (Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader) partly, at the intreatie of ſome of my familiar friends, and partly, through the deſire which I hid to put to light, ſo worthy a worke. There hath been as yet, but five parts thereof publiſhed in Engliſh, although, there are to the number of twentie four parts thereof in moſt of other Languages. Wherefore thinking it in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, as well worthy the tranſlation as any other Hiſtories of the like nature, I did ſo far preſume upon my owne abilities (and to benefit my ſelfe in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) as to begin the Tranſlation thereof: Yet I had not the leaſt intent to have it come into the publique view. But being (as I have ſaid) inſtigated and earneſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereunto, I have now preſumed to publiſh the ſame. Not having ſo much confidence of my owne weak
<pb facs="tcp:52725:3"/>abilities, as to imagine, that it will be accepted of and liked by all, but rather hoping that ſome will looke on it, and value it not according to the worth, but the good will of the writer. As for ſuch, as either raſhly condemne without judgment, or laviſhly diſlike without advice: I eſteeme them like feathers, ſoone diſperſt with every blaſt, accounting their diſcontent my content, not caring to pleaſe every <hi>Momus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I deſire is, to have the good opinion of the well-affected to Learning, and that I hope (Gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) you will favourably afford me; which if you doe, I ſhall account my ſelf much obliged to you, my labor and time well imploied, and my ſelfe (by my future engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to my ability, in ſomewhat of the like nature, or ſome more worthy work) bound to be alwayes ready, and willing to requite your kindneſs.</p>
            <p>But if I ſhall find the contrary, (and that I too boldly building on your courteſies, he wounded with repentance, and brought to deſpaire) then you will render me alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uſeleſs, not daring to venture any more being blaſted in my firſt deſignes. Thus hoping that you will peruſe this (as an earneſt of my further travailes) with ſo favourable an aſpect, as that I may be emboldned to proceed in the following parts of this Hiſtory,</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE newes of theſe Princes and Lords, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Gentlewomen, enchanted in the firme Iſland, as you have heard, was ſoon known by little <hi>PERION</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> ſon of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who had been left by his father in Great Britaine, under the Government of good old <hi>Arban,</hi> King of <hi>Norwales.</hi> This young Prince being then about the age of twelve or thirteen years, had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52725:6"/>a reſolution in himſelfe, to receive the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at the hands of his brother the Emperor <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and of none other: but ſeeing himſelf fruſtrated of his purpoſe, he lingred until the fourth yeare following: when two of the ſons of <hi>Don Floreſtan</hi> King of <hi>Sardinia</hi> came to viſit him, at <hi>London.</hi> The one whereof was called <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> as his father, the other <hi>Parmenir,</hi> in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were alſo <hi>Vaillides</hi> ſon to <hi>Don Bruneo,</hi> King of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigne, Languines</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> children of <hi>Agries</hi> King of <hi>Scotland, Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſon to King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> and <hi>Quedragant</hi> Lord of <hi>Sanſuegue,</hi> who were departed from their ſeverall Countries, hoping to be made Knights by the ſame hand, of whom <hi>Perion</hi> ſhould obteine this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The young Prince received him as welcome; as the neerneſſe of their kindred rendred him affectionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, eſpecially having heard occaſion of their long voyage. To ſatisfie which deſire, they reſolved to take their journey to <hi>Ireland,</hi> towards King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> there being at that time no Prince more worthy to ſupply the place of the Emperor <hi>Eſplandian</hi> in his abſence. <hi>Perion</hi> having a deſire, ſo ſoone as he ſhould have the meanes, to bear Armes, and follow ſtrange adventures, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his father in Proweſſe and Chivalrie: wherefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to have <hi>Yrguian</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gandalin</hi> for his Squire, he diſpatched a Gentleman of his towards <hi>Gandales</hi> (who at that time lived in the Caſtles of <hi>Archelaus</hi> which <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> had given him) earneſtly intreating him to fend <hi>Yr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guian</hi> to him, wherewith <hi>Gandales</hi> was content. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being arived, and theſe young Princes having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided all things neceſſarie for their journey, taking their leave of King <hi>Arban,</hi> they went ſtraite to the Port of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſe,</hi> where they imbarqued: And as they were on the Sea, they diſcovered a Barque with foure oares, green as emeraulds, wherewith foure Apes did row: and there was with them a very faire Damſel, coſtly adorned. Theſe Barques followed one another ſo cloſely, that they were joined and landed together. And as <hi>Perion</hi> and thoſe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52725:6"/>his Company were ready to mount on horſe-back, the ſtrange Damſel approached neer to them, carrying on her neck a ſword excellently garniſhed, and in her hand a black ſheild, in the middle whereof was painted a golden Sphere. Shee addreſſed her ſelfe to <hi>Perion,</hi> and kneeling on the ground, ſpake thus. Gentle ſir, God forbid that I ſhould ever part from your feet until you have granted me the Boon which I ſhall aske you. <hi>Perion</hi> whom ſhee much pleaſed, readily anſwered, Aske it then, and you ſhall not be refuſed. Truly ſaid ſhe, I hoped for no leſſe. Shee riſing from the ground, took him apart, and they talked ſo long in walking together, that they came neer to the barque where the Apes were: into which the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel prayed him to enter alone. Then <hi>Perion</hi> knew very well, that by too raſhly promiſing he had loſt his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: And although he was as much troubled at it, as at any thing that could happen to him whatſoever, even ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe fruſtrated of his purpoſe, and hindered from his voyage into <hi>Ireland:</hi> nevertheleſſe (knowing that his honour would be queſtioned, if he did not accompliſh that, in which he had voluntarily obliged himſelfe) he paſſed on, and called his Companions, to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that which the Damſel had requeſted him, and the cauſe wherefore he followed her, wherefore he intreated them earneſtly to excuſe him. You may eaſily judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were well pleaſed: But ſeeing that they could not remedie it, they recommended him to the keeping of our Lord, aſſuring him that ſo ſoon as they had received Knighthood, they would put themſelves in ſearch of him, whereſoever he ſhould be. They had hardly ſpoken theſe words when the Apes began to row, and the winde ſate ſo faire, that in a ſmall time they were far from Land, and they loſt the ſight of him. So let us leave him to the Seas at the pleaſure of fortune, and returne to the others, being reſolved to perſue their enterprize: And therefore they went to the Court of old <hi>Cildadan,</hi> who knowing of their arrival, honorably received them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52725:7"/>they had ſojourned a ſmal time in his Countrie, he gave them the order. Then they tooke leave of him, and entring into their ſhip, they ſet ſaile to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they ſound <hi>Liſvart,</hi> ſon to <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who was then eſteemed the moſt faire and accompliſhed Gentleman in the world. The old Emperor (who by reaſon of the abſence of his Children had left his ſolitary life, &amp; taken upon him the Government of <hi>Thrace</hi>) knowing that they were arrived at the Port, went downe and welcomed them: add from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them into his Pallace, where he and young <hi>Liſvart</hi> feaſted them for the ſpace of twelve dayes: who, having underſtood the loſſe of his Uncle <hi>Perion,</hi> and the enterpriſe of theſe new Knights which was to go ſeek him where ever he was, he reſolved to keepe them company. And for that purpoſe, the thirteenth day afterwards, as the Emperour aroſe from Table, he came and caſt himſelfe upon his knees before him, humbly entreating him to grant him one boon. The good man having the teares in his eyes, tooke him up, and granted him whatſoever he would. Sir ſaid he, I have underſtood by theſe Knights, that my Uncle <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> hath been lead by a ſtrange Damſell, and no man knows whither: May it therefore pleaſe you not to be diſpleaſed, if I goe my ſelfe to ſeeke him; for I never had a deſire to receive Knight-hood of any other then of him: being ſure that of a better I cannot attain to ſuch honour, ſeeing that he is the Son of King <hi>Amadis,</hi> Father to my Father, who hath ſurpaſſed all others in great proweſſe and wiſdome. My Son, anſwered the Emperour, this parting will be very grieveous to me; for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence gave my old yeares ſome comfort in the abſence and loſſe of your Parents. Nevertheleſſe ſeeing that I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to your demands, I am willing that your will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. At this time <hi>Liſvart</hi> might be about the age of ſeventeen yeares: he was ſo great, and well formed, that one would have eſteemed him more then twenty. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having the Reynes on his owne neck, to doe what ſeemed him good, he endeavoured in all diligence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52725:7"/>and furniſh three great ſhips, into the one of which he entred, accompanied with <hi>Floreſtan, Parmenir</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Galuanes</hi> brother of <hi>Languines:</hi> in the other <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illades</hi> and <hi>Quedragant;</hi> and in the third <hi>Languines</hi> with <hi>Abies.</hi> Then having taken leave of the Emperour, they commanded to weigh anchors, and hoiſe the ſailes; and ſayling in the maine Sea, in an hours ſpace they loſt the ſight of the great City. So we will returne to <hi>Perion,</hi> and the fortunes which he had, we will leave the others alone untill we ſhall have more leaſure.</p>

                  </gap>hat he put on the Coat of Maile, and the reſt of the Harneſs except the Helmet, which ſhe took between her armes: and iſſuing out of the barque, they began to goe up into the Iſland, ſo long that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52725:8"/>they came into a great plain, where <hi>Perion</hi> asked her in what place they were; but ſhe anſwered him no otherwiſe but that he ſhould know hereafter. And ſo diſcourſing, they ſaw a great City, the circuit whereof ſeemed in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to containe more then three miles: and the nearer they came to it, the more lofty the place ſeemed to <hi>Perion,</hi> were it in highneſs of Walls, ſtrength of Towers, or great Bulwarks. And hee would very willingly have preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his guide to tell him the name of the place, but her former anſwer contradicted his deſire to enquire further: in ſuch ſort that he held his peace until they entred into it. Then he very well knew that the excellency of it without, was nothing comparable to that which he ſaw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as well in faire Houſes, as golden Pallaces; as well of people, as of magnificent Temples, Colloſſo's and things of antiquity that he knew not what to thinke. Which the Damſell knowing, ſhe ſaid to him: Now it is good for your profit and honour, that you ſpeake not one word to any man who ſhall talke to you, before that I command you, otherwiſe evill may happen to you Damſell anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Perion,</hi> I will hold my peace then, ſeeing that it is your pleaſure. And ſo diſcourſing, they came to the entrance of a Pallace, being the Principall of them all, as it might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perceived: before which many Knights and other perſons walked, who ſeeing <hi>Perion</hi> and the ſtrange Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell goe up the ſteps, followed them to ſee what adventure it might be. And entring into a very great Hall hung with Tappeſtry, <hi>Perion</hi> perceived under a Canopie of cloth of Gold an honourable old man, having on his head an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Crowne; and near him many Kings, Dukes, Earls and Barons, who all did greatly honour and reverence him; and towards whom <hi>Alquefa</hi> (holding <hi>Perion</hi> by the hand) approached; and kneeling on the ground, ſaid to him, Moſt high excellent and redoubted Emperour, my Father (your humble ſervant) kiſſeth the hands of your Majeſtie, and humbly entreateth you, that without delay you beſtow Knight-hood on this Gentleman, for he ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52725:8"/>as well imploy it as any other living. The Emperour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knew the Damſell, as her whom he had many times ſcene with her Father <hi>Alquif</hi> the Negromancer: wherefore he kindly received her; and caſting his eyes on <hi>Perion,</hi> he ſeemed ſo fair, and of ſo goodly a ſtature, that he was moved to ſpeake theſe words: Truly it is eaſie to believe, that of ſo excellent a perſon, ſhould iſſue no other then faire and Knightly deeds; wherefore Damſell I will ſatisfie your Fathers will, ſeeing that he prayes me. And ſo addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Perion,</hi> he asked him from whence he came, but he anſwed never a word, according to the promiſe which he made to <hi>Alquefa,</hi> who ſpake for him, ſaying to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: Sir, I intreat you to pardon him; for without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying his faith, he cannot at preſent diſcourſe with you, or any other of this Court Well anſwered he, he ſhall ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; in the meane time lead him to the Ladyes, to th'end that they may ſee him; and to morrow after the watch, I will give him the Order. <hi>Alquefa</hi> aroſe and was led with <hi>Perion</hi> into the Chamber of the Empreſſe, whom ſhe ſaluted, as ſhe knew well how to doe; then ſhe ſaid to her, Madam, my Father hath ſent you this Gentleman, whom he prayes you to receive, as him who deſerves, being iſſued of a Linage very well knowne amongſt the beſt Knights in the world. Then <hi>Perion</hi> approached and kiſſed her hands. By my God anſwered the Empreſſe, if Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood be as well accompliſhed in him, as his beauty: hee will be (by all reaſon) the moſt accompliſhed in armes, as hath been theſe hundred yeares. <hi>Perion</hi> made great obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to her, without ſpeaking one word, and at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant came <hi>Onolerea</hi> and <hi>Gricilerea,</hi> Daughters of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, eſteemed ſuch, that in all <hi>Aſia,</hi> their equall in beauty could not be found: which <hi>Perion</hi> marvelling at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for <hi>Gricilerea,</hi> could not forbeare, but he ſaid in himſelfe: Good God! Ladyes, in whom nature hath taken great pleaſure to make faire! for I never thought in all my life, to ſee that amongſt all living, which I now ſee in you two. Then being ſurprized with an affection not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52725:9"/>he ſo changed his colour that <hi>Aquefa</hi> perceived it. Wherefore addreſſing her ſpeech to <hi>Gricilerea,</hi> who was the youngeſt, ſhe ſaid to her; Madam, my Father ſends you word by me, that hee hath choſen this Gentleman to ſerve you as your Knight, and adviſeth you to receive and accept him for ſuch a one, for he will obey you even as your greatneſſe deſerveth. She rightly touched the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of this Princeſſe, for Love had at that inſtant bound her by the preſence of <hi>Perion,</hi> in ſuch manner that ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to <hi>Alquefa:</hi> Your Father hath long ſince made me this promiſe, I believe him and follow his advice, ſeeing that it pleaſed the Emperour to command me the ſame day that he took leave of him: And that he aſſured me of what I ſee, which is the faireſt Gentleman in the World. But for all this, <hi>Perion</hi> ſpake not one word, but made his eyes ſerve as an interpreter, which carried to the heart of this princeſſe all the thanks which the tongue could expreſſe exerciſing its office: Nevertheleſs there was none of them, who were not aſtoniſhed to ſee him ſo dumb, and amongſt others <hi>Onolorea,</hi> who (being ſurprized with a certaine jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie for the good of her Siſter) ſaid to <hi>Alquefa:</hi> I pray you Damſell advertize your Father, that my ſiſter will be very harſh, if ſhe ſhould refuſe the preſent which he hath ſent her by you; at which I am not angry, but I would that he would have as good remembrance of me, as hee hath had of her, although that the Gentleman cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelfe for the rigour which he uſeth towards us, not deigning to ſpeak to any of us. Madam, anſwered <hi>Alquefa,</hi> it is at preſent forbidden him, ſome other time he ſhall make amends for this fault: And as for my Father, hee knows what is needfull for you; alſo he hath commanded me to tell you, that he hath in guard ſuch a one, that you ſhall wiſh well to him all your life; and he will bring him in ſhort time. He ſhall be very welcome anſwered ſhe.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52725:9"/>in perfection of Love, that there never was two more true lovers, as by our Hiſtory you ſhall know hereafter.

Then going from the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the new Knight was conducted into the great Hall of

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the dinner was ended, and as the Clothes were taken away, there entred into the Hall a Knight armed at all points, except his hands and head: He was of very great ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and was followed by ten Knights, twenty Squires, and one Damſell, in very good Order. He had hanging at his neck a very rich ſhield, in the middle whereof, there was portracted a Lady of moſt excellent beauty. He being come before the Emperour, put his knee to the ground; and all the company appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched together to heare what he would ſay. Then he ſpake in this manner.</p>
               <p>Moſt Mighty Emperour of <hi>Trebiſond;</hi> the cauſe which at this time, cauſeth me to preſent my ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Majeſty; is to let you know that I who am Duke of <hi>Orcalea,</hi> by name <hi>Alpatrafie,</hi> do love a Damſel, named <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aleſtrea,</hi> Daughter to a Knight, a great Lord my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And as I have divers times told her the good will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52725:10"/>which I beare her; So ſhe hath aſſured me that ſhe would not love me, before that I have been in the Courts of all the Kings and Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to maintaine that her beauty exceedeth all the excellency which other Ladyes and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells are endewed with; and if any contradict it, let them touch the Image portracted in this ſhield, the which is her Figure; and I will combate with them, and bring them to that condition, that they ſhall yield themſelves Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to my Lady, to whom I am bound to ſend them. And if fortune ſhall enable me to remain vanquiſher of all thoſe who ſhall enterprize the combate againſt me, then I ſhall enjoy her love, otherwiſe not. And to th'end that ſhe may have good aſſurance of what ſhall happen, ſhe hath given charge to this Damſell, named <hi>Eſtreliene</hi> to follow me, to make her a true report of my actions. I have already traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many far Countries, &amp; fought with above fifty Knights, whom I have all ſent to her: and Sir I hope to be no leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous in this your Court, then I have been in others: and therefore if there be any one who will contradict the beauty of my Lady, let him come preſently and touch the ſhield, and prepare himſelfe for the Combate. Then the Knight held his peace, looking on the countenance of thoſe who hearkened to him: but there was none ſo hardy to open his mouth to ſpeak one word, although that the moſt part of them had before their eyes, thoſe whom they hold for their Ladyes and loves. Yet the greatneſs of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous Kinght, made them loſe their hearts, ſpeech, and force; at which <hi>Perion</hi> being aſtoniſhed, caſt his eyes on the Infanta <hi>Gricilerea,</hi> and ſeeing that ſhe looked upon him as though ſhe called him to ſuccour her, being moved with an exreame deſire to doe her ſervice, he altogether forgot the promiſe which he had made to <hi>Alquefa,</hi> not to ſpeake without her leave. And ſo approaching neare to the Duke of <hi>Orcalea,</hi> he laid hands on the ſhield with ſuch great force, that he pulled it from his neck, caſting it with ſo great ſtength to the ground, that he broke it in pieces; ſaying ſo loud that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>. By my head Sir
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52725:11"/>Knight, this is too great blaſphemy againſt ſo honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Company. And if it pleaſe God this injurie ſhall not be done them in my preſence, ſo long as I have the meanes to defend them! Theſe words ſo bravely ſpoken by <hi>Perion,</hi> did very much pleaſe all that heard him: and more eſpecially, her for whoſe love it had been enterprized: Nevertheleſs <hi>Alpatrafie</hi> as modeſtly anſwered: In good faith Knight, you uſe ſo little courtefie that you deſerve to be greatly blamed, but the means that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuddenly to take in open battell, hinders me at this time to ſay that which I thinke. <hi>Perion</hi> held his peace: For <hi>Alquefa</hi> mightily reproved him for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without her licence. Nevertheleſs quoth ſhe, ſeeing that you have ſo much forgotten your ſelfe, goe forwards, and with Gods help you will end all with honour: Wherefore Sir ſaid ſhe to the Emperor, may it pleaſe you to give him a horſe, for I have brought him hither as you know on foot. Truly anſwered he, that is a very reaſonable requeſt, ſeeing that he himſelfe will defend the honors of ſo many Ladies as are here preſent. Then he commanded a Squire to fetch him one of the beſt horſes in his ſtable: In the mean time the Duke alighted and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf for the Combate, and aſſoone <hi>Perion</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into the field by the Dukes of <hi>Ortelenſaude la Fonta.</hi> The Emperor, together with the Ladies placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs at the windowes, and as the two Combatants were readie to doe their devoir, the Trumpets began to ſound, wherefore they ran one againſt the othher with ſo great force, that the Duke broke bis lance on the new Knight, who failed of his attempt: But in paſſing, they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with bodies and heads with ſuch force, that horſes and men meaſured their length on the ground, that every one thought them to be dead. Which <hi>Gricilerea</hi> ſeeing ſhe became extreame ſad: and as the tears came from her eyes, ſhe perceived <hi>Perion</hi> to riſe up, being aſhamed of his miſhap.

But in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the Dukes chance altered: for he began to faint, and on the other ſide the new Knight ſeemed more quick and nimble then before. Certainly, he who had then taken notice of the countenance of <hi>Gricilerea,</hi> the viſage which ſhe bore gave teſtimony enough of the pleaſure which ſhe had in her ſoul, ſeeing her Lover ready to have the victory: who lifting up his head, eſpied her from among all the others. For which cauſe he redoubled his forces in ſuch manner, that he reached the Duke ſuch a blow on his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and wounded his head ſo rightly, that he fell down aſtoniſhed. Then he advanced him, and by his ſtrength broke the buckles of his Helmet: and diſarmed him, ready to kill him: when <hi>Eſtreleiene</hi> entred into the field, and caſting her ſelfe on her knees, ſhe intreated <hi>Perion</hi> to have mercy on him. Nevertheleſs he ſeemed to be deafe to her demands, and for this cauſe ſhe being very much diſcontented, addreſſed her ſelfe to <hi>Alquefa,</hi> intreated her with doubled hands to intreat for her. Which ſhe refuſed not, but ſaid to <hi>Perion,</hi> Knight, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelfe with this victory, and for my ſake ſave the Duke. At theſe words <hi>Perion</hi> retired back, and wipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſword on the green graſſe, he put it up in the ſheath.

The ſtrange Damſel humbly thanked her, and at that preſent <hi>Perions</hi> horſe was brought to him, upon which he mounted, but before he departed out of the field, <hi>Alquefa</hi> ſpake ſoftly to him, Sir Knight, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that without any further delay we return into our Barque, (from whence (if you keep your promiſe) you may not depart without my conſent: And likewiſe I pray you, that from henceforth you cauſe your ſelfe to be

Saying ſo, ſhe ſtruck her palfery, and <hi>Perion</hi> followed her with great grief, ſeeing himſelf ſo ſoon barred from the preſence of his new Ladie: of whom he could not by any meanes take any other leave, but only by paſſing by the window where ſhe and her ſiſter were ſeated, there he looked upon her with ſo pittiful a Countenance, that ſhe might eaſily know the grief wherewith he was accompanyed; And from thence he and <hi>Alquefa</hi> rode to the Barque, into which he entred, And the Apes began to rowe. The Emperor and thoſe of his Company being abaſhed at their ſo ſudden departure, did not know at the firſt what to think, nevertheleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that all this had happened by the adviſe of the ſage Father of <hi>Alquefa,</hi> they made the leſs wonder at it. And during theſe paſſages, the Duke was carried out of the field, who without any long ſtay in the Country, where he had been ſo illy handled, he (with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) took the way which he had come ſo ſad, that death had been very agreeable to him.

And in this diſtreſſe the ſhip wherein <hi>Vaillides</hi> and <hi>Quedragant</hi> were arived at the break of day, very neer to a faire Iſle, which was ſoone known by the Mariners to be the Iſle of the <hi>Fueille Blanche,</hi> and the Lord of it was one of the cruelleſt Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants in the world, named <hi>Argamont</hi> the valiant; This <hi>Argamont</hi> had a daughter named <hi>Dardadie,</hi> who was very well known of <hi>Ardan Comile:</hi> he which <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> vanquiſhed in the town of <hi>Fenuſe,</hi> as the ſecond book largely declareth.

And they tarryed not long before <hi>Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> came out from his Fort, and armed with plates of fine ſteele, mounted on a great Horſe, came before the Knights, to whom he ſaid in a great bravado: Poore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ones, how dare you appeare before me?

During this diſcourſe, the Giant contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on the perſon of <hi>Quedragant,</hi> who ſeemed to him a fair Knight. And for this cauſe, he ſomewhat appeaſed his Choller, and ſaid to him; Truly I do believe that you are a good Knight, nevertheleſs you may eaſily know, that your ſtrength in reſpect of mine, is little or nothing. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is your deſire to come both together, you ſhall ſoone ſee what honour you will purchaſe by trying your ſelves againſt me, ſo as you brag. And having ſpoken theſe words, he lifted up a great Mace which he had in his hand, thinking to ſtrike <hi>Quedragant:</hi> Then <hi>Vaillides,</hi> who was ſomewhat behind, knowing his will, couched his Lance, and giving ſpurs to his Horſe, charged <hi>Argamont</hi> ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was ready to fall from his Horſe.

Upon this aſſurance, <hi>Vaillides</hi> and <hi>Quedragant</hi> tooke him by the armes, and as they led him to his Caſtle, they met <hi>Almatrafa</hi> his Wife, who having ſeen him fall, came to entreat the Knights to have mercy on him: but ſeeing that they were made friends, ſhe asked him if he were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded: No anſwered he, thanks to our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> in whom I now doe and will alwaies believe, and ſo shall all thoſe that wiſh me well. O <hi>Jupiter!</hi> cryed the Gianteſſe, what doe <hi>I</hi> heare? will you looſe your ſelfe, and yours ſo fooliſhly?

                  </gap> to the foot of a high Rock, where there was a little path-way which led to the top. So <hi>Alquefa</hi> ſhewed it to <hi>Perion,</hi> and ſaid to him, Sir Knight, I pray you by the faith which you owe to God, and the thing which you love beſt in this world, that you will follow this way, which will lead you to the top of the Rock: where you ſhall finde a plain Country, and a Fountaine in the middle. Tarrie for me there, and whatſoever happen to you, do not depart from it, before you have newes of me to the contrary, and remember your ſelfe of the promiſe you have made
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52725:16"/>me. Damſel quoth he, you may aſſure your ſelf that the fear of death ſhall not cauſe me to falſifie my word to you. Then he landed, and taking his horſe by the reines, he mounted on him, and rode on to the top of the Rock, until he found the Plaine, even as <hi>Alquefa</hi> had told him. It was at that time ſun-ſet &amp; neer night, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſolved to goe no further, but to ſtay till the morning: and therefore he alighted from his horſe, and did eat ſomething that he had brought with him, then he ſlept until the break of day, when as he mounted on his horſe. And when he had rid about halfe the day, he ſaw the fountaine, in the moſt pleaſant and delectable place that could be imagined, and the water iſſued from twelve pipes, a croſſe, a piller: upon which was erected the Effigies of a Knight, armed at all points, except the the Helmet and Gantlets, and he held in his left hand an Emperors Crown, and in his right a Roll of Coper Gilt: Wherein was ingraved latine letters, which ſaid, In the time that this Crowne ſhall be in the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his eſtate, and that the horrible cries, and great yelling ſhall be aſſwaged, the flower of Chivalry ſhall flouriſh, abaſing the pride of many, with the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Sword. <hi>Perion</hi> read and read againe, very often this Prophecie, and in the reading he tooke ſingular pleaſure in the antiquitie of the Image: For he had heard it told to King <hi>Amadis</hi> his Father, that in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> upon the Hell gate, there was juſt ſuch another, which was certainly believed to be erected by A <hi>Polidon</hi> himſelf. Thus the Knight of the Sphere contemplating on the ſtrange things which he beheld, he ſaw two of the Apes of his Barque who erected him a faire Arbor: whither they brought ſuch abundance of victuals, that there was ſufficient to keep him twelve or fifteen whole dayes. But at that inſtant he heard the neighing of horſes; wherefore hee looked about him on all fides, to ſee what it was. Then he ſaw a very great Giant on horſeback, holding in his hand a tough and ſtrong Javelin, and he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52725:16"/>had ten men very well armed following him, and in a Charriot drawn with four horſes: wherein was bound and fettered an old man, having his beard ſo while and long, that it reached below his girdle, and beſides him two Knights alſo covered with their armes, ſhackled with fetters, and great irons on their feet. The Giant did not ſee <hi>Perion</hi> till he came very neer him; but ſo ſoon as he ſaw him ſhaking his Javelin, he began to crie. Unfortunate Creature! what Devil hath brought you to this place, to end your life ſo unfortunately, and the Knight of the Sphere was no whit danted at his threats, but ſuddenly drawing forth his Sword anſwered him: By my head great villain you have good reaſon to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me, in reſpect of the ill which you ſhall receive at my hands: for Jeſus Chriſt who is my guide, being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at the tyranny wherein you have ſo long lived, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth me ſtrength to revenge thoſe whom thou haſt troubled all thy life, who I will preſently deſtroy, to ſend thy ſoule to the Devil, of whom thou lately didſt ſpeak; The Giant was ſo angrie at theſe words, that he ſpurred his horſe to run upon the Knight of the Sphere: but he went forwards, giving him ſuch a blow with his Lance on his right ſhoulder, that the paine conſtrained him to let fall his Javelin: nevertheleſs he quickly laid bands on a Mace of Iron, which hung at his ſaddle bow; And as they both turned about at the end of their Courſe for to joine together again, the Giants horſe ſet his foot in a hole, and fell ſo heavily under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that he broke his neck. Which the Knight of the Sphere ſeeing, he ſuddenly alighted, and cut of his head, then he mounted again; for he heard thoſe who led the priſoners, cry with a loud voice, Traitor, Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, you ſhall die without remedie, and it ſhall boot you nothing to ſlie. Then they ran upon <hi>Perion,</hi> who in good time for him was unexpectedly ſuccoured by three Knights, each of them carrying a ſhield of Gold, in the middle whereof was a great Croſſe red as blood, thoſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52725:17"/>of whom I ſpeak, ſeeing ſo great ods, as ten againſt one, reſolved to aid the weakeſt: and for this cauſe pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the viſor of their Helmets, juſt as thoſe of the Giants partly charged the Knight of the Sphere, they entred pell mell, and at their arivall they unhorſed three that they never ſpake again. The Knight of the Sphere being abaſhed at ſo ready aid, would make them to know, that he had a part in the practiſe, in ſuch manner, that they four played their parts ſo well, that in the end they all ten loſt their lives, the three Croſſed men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring who he ſhould be that they had aided; for they never ſaw a Knight fight more hardily and better. One while they had an opinion that it was <hi>Amadis,</hi> or <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> his ſon, then on a ſudden knowing that they were enchanted, they altered their minde, and rather thought him to be <hi>Norandal,</hi> or the valiant <hi>Frandalo;</hi> but they had often ſeen them in ſuch skirmiſhes, and they never came neer him in vallor, towards whom they advanced, praying him for courteſie to tell him his name. Sirs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, the Croſſe which you bear betokening you to be Chriſtians, and the good aid which I have received of you, obligeth me to ſatisfie your requeſt. My name (ſo long as it pleaſeth a Damſel who hath ſent me hither) is the Knight of the Sphere, as thoſe who are acquint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, call me <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> Son of <hi>Amadis</hi> King of great Britaine. He had no ſooner ended his words, but the three croſſed came to embrace him, praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God for ſo happy a meeting. How? ſaid <hi>Perion</hi> doe you then know me? Know you? anſwered one of them, yes truly, and for good cauſe, ſeeing that I am your kinſman <hi>Talanque,</hi> ſon of <hi>Galaor,</hi> brother to the King your father, and this is <hi>Mancly,</hi> a well eſteemed Knight amongſt the beſt in the world. Truly ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> this adventure is the beſt for me that I could have wiſht for: but I pray you tell me who is the third. Sir anſwered <hi>Talanque,</hi> this is ſhe who keeps me from marrying Queen <hi>Calafea</hi> of whom you have ſometimes heard. Yes, by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52725:17"/>my faith ſaid he, although that I never thought to have ſeen a woman endowed with ſo good a heart, and o great Proweſſe. Then <hi>Talanque</hi> called the Queen, and ſaid to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore knowing that it was <hi>Perion,</hi> ſhe caſt down her ſheild: and ſetting her knees to the ground ſhe would have kiſſed his hands; But he lifted her up, and ſaid to her, how Madam, is this the faſhion at <hi>Califor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sir ſaid ſhe, wives are obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the commands of their husbands, otherwiſe be ſure that without death, or cruel impriſonment you ſhould not eſcape from me. They all fell alaughing at the good grace wherewith the Queen ſpake theſe threatnings. And as they were thus talking, the Priſoners who were bound to the Cart (as you have underſtood) found the means to cut the cords, and come to the Knight of the Sphere, who going to the old man that went before them all, he ſaid to them: Alas old man, what ſiniſter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune have you to be brought into ſuch miſery in your old years! Sir, anſwered he, I will alwayes praiſe the Lord, and bleſſe him for you who have delivered me from death. And before I tell you any further, I humbly intreat you for Gods ſake to grant me one gift which ſhall coſt you little, and which you cannot refuſe as I thinke: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering your goodneſs, who hath compaſſion of poore, miſerable afflicted perſons, as I am. Father, ſaid the Knight of the Sphere, you ſhall have your pleaſure of me. That which I require of you, anſwered the good man, is, that you give me my liberty, and that for this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52725:18"/>time you enquire of my Eſtate: and I will at one time or other acknowledge the favor which you have done me. Truly ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> ſeeing that it is your pleaſure to hide your ſelfe from me, I am content. Then he asked the others who had ſo chained them; but they were ſo ill, that they could not ſuddenly know him who ſpake to them, although that to finde him they were entred into ſearch with <hi>Liſvart.</hi> They had been hitherto covered with their Helmets: wherefore it was no marvel, if <hi>Perion</hi> himſelf did not know them, untill they took heart, and as they thought they had dreamed, lifting their hands to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſtretching forth their armes, they cryed: Ah God! is this which we now ſee with our owne eyes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be true? Saying, ſo, they pulled off their Helmets, and ſtooped down to kiſſe the feet of <hi>Perion,</hi> who knew them to be <hi>Languines</hi> and <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> two of his Companions; he was ſo glad, that in embracing them, he ſaid to the Croſſed Knights, My friends, if you knew who theſe Gentlemen are, perhaps you would have part of my great pleaſure. Then he related to them how they departed out of great Britaine together, and what adventure had ſeparated them. <hi>Talanque, Manoly,</hi> and the Queen <hi>Calaſe a</hi> did much marvel: all which the Knight of the Sphere led into the Arbor: Nevertheleſs, before they arived there, the old man departed from them: and monnting on one of the horſes who had loſt their Maſters, he ſled with a great gallop through the Foreſt, at which the Knight of the Sphere began to laugh, ſaying to the others: I think this good man thinks he is purſued by the Giant. See I pray, if fear doe not ſharpen his ſpurs, which I would forgive him with a very good will, if I knew his name. But you who have been with him, ſaid he, to <hi>Languines</hi> and <hi>Abies,</hi> cannot you reſolve me in this point? In good faith, anſwered they, we have as little knowledge of him as you, for know, ſaid <hi>Languines,</hi> that my Companion and I depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Port of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to goe in ſearch of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52725:18"/>you, ſo ſoon as we had ſet ſaile, there aroſe ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, that at the end of three weeks we were at <hi>Paleſtine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And at an ill time as we were a refreſhing our ſelves, we were charged by fifteen Knights, who iſſued out of a Grove, they ſurprized us before we were ready: Nevertheleſs we defended our ſelves a long time againſt them.

Then our reſiſtance was of little force, and we remained his priſoners cauſing us to be changed, juſt as you have found us in the good houre. By my head anſwered <hi>Perion,</hi> I never heard of ſo marvellous an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the event is ſo good, God be thanked.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52725:19"/>for this cauſe they thought good to Land, and goe to the Emperour, of whom they might have more certaine ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. So they furniſhed themſelves ſo well as they could, eſpecially <hi>Liſvart</hi> who was one of the faireſt Creatures that could be; and mounting on Horſe back, they went into the Towne, and came to the Palace where they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and paſſing further, they came into a great Hall, where the Emperour was in company of many Knights, and wiſe men. At their arivall every one did reverence them, and gave way to them to approach neare his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie; <hi>Liſvart</hi> who marched before them all, ſpake thus to him; Sir, your high renowne and great bounty, knowne throughout the whole world, hath moved my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and me, to come into this your Court; not onely to doe you reverence, as your Majeſties greatneſſe doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but alſo in hoping to have good newes of a young Gentleman, who (as it hath beene told us) you have made Knight not long ſince, at the requeſt of a Damſell who lately brought him hither to you. And Sir, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I never had intention to receive Knight-hood, at the hands of any other then his; and that my age ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth me to take more upon me then I have heretofore done: I humbly intreat you to tell us what you know, to th'end that having found him, I may have that which I hope for, and deſire above all things. The Emperour (being a gracious and affable Prince) anſwered <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vart,</hi> that hee and all his Company were very welcome. And as for the young Knight, ſaid he, which you ſeek, aſſure your ſelves, my friends, that at preſent I know no news of him: at which I am grieved; for I love and eſteeme him, as much as any other that I know becauſe of the great begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Knight-hood which I ſaw in him; and aſſure your ſelves, that I am altogether ignorant of the reſt of his Eſtate: for he left this Court after ſo ſtrange a manner, that when I thinke thereof, I believe to have dreamed. Sir, anſwered <hi>Liſvart,</hi> I will certifie unto you, that he is ſonne to the hardy Knight <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> King of great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

She was clad with a Garment of white cut Satin, and faſtned with Buttons of Gold, and great knobs of Orientall Stones: ſhe had on her head a Garland of Flowers, under which Garland was ſeene ſo great excellent and incomparable raviſhing beauty, that it was ſufficient to entertaine the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed man in the World. At her ſide went two old men, having their Beards reaching downe to their Girdles, being excellently well ſet forth with threds of Gold and Silke: and behind them was three Knights armed at all points. This Damſell being come before the Emperour, did put her knee to the ground to kiſs his hand: but he ſeeing her in ſo good equipage, graciouſly tooke her up, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her what ſhe would have. Sir, ſaid ſhe, I humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you, that you would be pleaſed to hearken to me, and aid me in what I ſhall moſt humbly entreate of you. Yes truly anſwered the Emperour; Sir, ſaid ſhe, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of your great bounty hath emboldned me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from my owne Country, and come into this your Court to find remedy in an affaire which is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to me; nevertheleſſe, ſeeing that your cuſtome is to helpe the afflicted (as I have underſtood) I hope not to

No truly anſwered the Emperor, and you may freely ask what you pleaſe, and I will to my power ſatisfie you. The Damſel moſt humbly thanked him. Sir ſaid ſhe, ſeeing that you doe me ſo much favor, I would intreat you to permit me to aske one boon of my Lady <hi>Onolorea</hi> your daughter, and joine with me in prayer to her to grant it. Damſel anſwered the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, I will that my daughter be no leſs liberall in this caſe then I am, and I beleeve you will finde her ſo. At theſe words the Damſel addreſſed her ſelfe to <hi>Onolorea,</hi> and with an humble countenance ſaid to her: Moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and excellent Princeſſe, I humbly intreat you not to take it ill at my hands, if I addreſs my ſelf to you, as to the moſt courteous and faireſt this day living, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of you one gift which will coſt you little: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it concernes me ſo neerly, that my life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends thereon. The <hi>Infanta</hi> having already heard the will of the Emperor, anſwered to her: Damſel my friend, you ſhall have of me all that is in my power to grant you. By my God ſaid ſhe, I alwayes thought ſo: therefore then there remaines no more, but that you intreat this faire young Gentleman who ſits neer you, that he alone, and without delay, follow me whither I ſhall conduct him, I being certaine that he will obey you whatſoever you ſhall command him. <hi>Onolorea</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fault ſhe committed, by ſo unadviſedly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, remained penſive, and in great perplexity, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſo ſoon the thing which ſhe loved the beſt in the world: To ſhun which, ſhe anſwered the Damſel: In good faith, he is ſo lately come to the Emperor, and I have done ſo little for him, that he hath good reaſon to refuſe me: but intreat him your ſelfe, and it may be he will agree to your requeſt. As for me, I have no power over him, as to command him. But <hi>Liſvart</hi> being willing to aſſure the contrary, ſuddenly aroſe, and putting his knee to the ground, ſaid to her: Madam, ſeeing that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52725:23"/>you have granted one gift to this Damſel, may it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleaſe you to grant me another.</p>
               <p>Fair Sir, ſaid ſhe, I am very willing. I intreat you then Madam, ſaid he, to ſatisfie this which ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted of you, and permit me that I follow her by your Command. <hi>Onolorea</hi> knew well that ſhe was beſet on every ſide: wherefore not being able to recoile, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him: Goe then, and God be your guide. <hi>Liſvart</hi> humbly thanked her, and ſaid to the Damſel, that he was ready to mount on horſeback when ſhe pleaſed. That ſhall be preſently then anſwered ſhe. And at that time they both taking their leaves of the Court, depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But they had hardly paſſed out of the City walls, when an Eſquire preſented himſelfe before the Emperor, and ſaid to him: Sir, the Duke of <hi>Dardarie</hi> hath been defeated by the King of <hi>Breigne,</hi> and he is now beſieged by him, in the Town of <hi>Autruſque,</hi> being readie to be ruined, both he and his people, if you do not ſend him aid. This news did much trouble the Court, and the Duke of <hi>Ortilenſa</hi> was ſuddenly commanded to take with him ten thouſand Horſemen, and twenty thouſand foot-men to goe preſently, and raiſe the ſiege: for which he wiſely provided. And in theſe paſſages <hi>Parmenir, Floreſtan,</hi> and <hi>Galuanes,</hi> Companions of <hi>Liſvart,</hi> tarrying for his return, determined to goe in this expedition. And they intreated the Emperor to tell them the cauſe, wherefore this war had been enterprized between him and his enemy. My friends anſwered he, he hath rebelled againſt me, and hath uſurped and taken from me by treaſon, the Towns of <hi>Breigne</hi> and <hi>Teredie,</hi> being ready to doe worſe, if he ſhould be ſuffered. Sin ſaid <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> to doe you ſervice, my Companions and I will goe in this ſervice, and will be imployed in whatſoever your Lieutenants ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, wherefore the Emperor thanked them: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, before they departed, they went to the Ladies, and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> addreſſing himſelfe to <hi>Onolorea,</hi> who was then talking with <hi>Griliana,</hi> ſaid to her: Madam, in waiting
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52725:23"/>for the returne of the fair young Gentleman, I will goe (if it may ſo ſtand with your good liking) into this war as your Knight: Yet under this Condition, that he being returned to you, you ſhall reſtore me to Madam <hi>Griliana,</hi> whoſe I am, and until then I will leave her my heart in hoſtage to diſpoſe of, as it ſhall pleaſe hee. At theſe words they began to laugh: and bee uſe the Empereſſe came neer them, <hi>Onolorea</hi> anſwered him no otherwiſe but thus: that God grant they may all return in ſhort time in good health. Nevertheleſs <hi>Galuanes</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Bridelena,</hi> and ſaid to her with great affection: Madam, command me then, that as yours I may imploy my ſelfe in this enterprize, to the end that being yours, I may with the more eaſe vanquiſh your enemies. In good faith, anſwered ſhe, you ſhall not be refuſed in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I doe therefore pray and require you. And taking a Ring from her finger, ſhe gave it him, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their alliance. Truly the pleaſure which they tooke in talking together, had been longer: But there entred a Dwarfe, the moſt deformed that could be: who without doing any reverence to the Emperor, or any other, preſented to him a Letter, ſealed with ſixtie ſeven Seales, which was read before all the Company.

               <p>The Emperor, and all the Court were very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at ſuch pitifull news, knowing this Letter to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly written by <hi>Melia</hi> the Enchantreſſe, and ſealed with her ſeale amongſt others, whereon was engraven a woman holding a naked ſword in her hand, and a Croſſe at her feet. And that which augmented the grief of many was the loſs of <hi>Liſvart,</hi> who under the ſhadow of equity, went joyfully to his death, whereunto the ſtrange Damſel led him; for which cauſe the <hi>Infanta Ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorea</hi> was ſo paſſionate, that ſhe being retired into her Chamber, caſt her ſelfe on her bed, and began to lament with the greateſt grief in the world, ſaying with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſighes and tears: O Lord of all the world! how hath it pleaſed you to permit, that I alone ſhould be the cauſe of all the ill that is to happen to Chriſtendome? Alas cruel death, longed for, and loved by the afflicted! wherefore doe you conſent that I live one whole houre, knowing in me the evil that ſhall redound to ſo many perions? And ſpeaking theſe words, <hi>Griliana came,</hi> who knowing part of her affections, doubted that ſhe would fall from bad to worſe: for ſhe was ready to ſwound at every word. Wherefore taking her in her armes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52725:24"/>her, ſhe ſaid: Madam, I did never yet think that you had ſo little conſtancie, and I wonder that you will give ſo much credit to a falſe witch, who hateth and is enemy to all vertue. Doe you think that our Lord (who is goodnes it ſelfe) will conſent to the ruine of ſo faire a young Gentleman as is yours? and leſſe to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Faith? Theſe are meere vanities, doe not beleeve them, and I pray be not ſo ſad before the time. Alas ſaid <hi>Onolorea,</hi> the fear which I have makes my heart ſo doubtful, and I would to God that this which you tell me were more true, then I think it to be; for I fear the worſt. Madam ſaid <hi>Griliana,</hi> as you are a great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, you ought to be more perfect then ſimple maids, who are commonly leſs endued with Conſtancie and Magnanimity of Courage, then they who have the title of daughters to a King, or great Princes: therefore be comforted: for if the Letters of <hi>Melia</hi> are ſuch as I think them, you may be very much blamed in doing thus as you doe, and afterwards you may conſider of it with repentance. <hi>Griliana</hi> knew ſo well how to give her ſo many reaſons, that from thenceforth ſhe carried her ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with more modeſtie then ſhe had begun. And in the meane time the Emperor conſulted about the Army, that he ſhould raiſe, to goe to the aid of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> the which was retarded until the return of the Duke of <hi>Ortilenſa,</hi> who diſlodged that very ſame day, and marched ſo long with his Army, that he encamped within a dayes Journey of the town of <hi>Autruſque.</hi> Of which the King of <hi>Breigne</hi> being advertiſed, he raiſed the Seige, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an Army of fifteen thouſand horſemen, and twentie thouſand foot, he marched directly to fight him. <hi>Dardarie</hi> who was beſieged had news of this in ſhort time: and for that cauſe, leaving a good garriſon in the Town, he marched on the flancks of his enemy, as well to hinder him from proviſions, as to be in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, if the Duke of <hi>Ortilenſa</hi> ſhould give him battel.</p>

And for this cauſe the King of <hi>Breigne</hi> raiſed his Seige, and came ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily againſt his enemy, who not being willing to be ſurprized, or otherwiſe circumvented, he ordered his battel as you ſhall preſently hear.

And in this equipage they marched by little and little neer to the King of <hi>Breigne,</hi> who had likewiſe divided his Army into three Squadrons; The firſt was led by <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> his Son; The ſecond by himſelf; and the third by the Duke of <hi>Alinga.</hi> Thus they lodged within two miles of a little Village, where the Duke of <hi>Ortilenſa</hi> ſtaid: and ſetting a good watch for all that night, they did not diſturbe one another untill the next morning when they diſlodged. And the King ſent word to the Duke by a Trumpet, that before noone was paſſed he would
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52725:25"/>make him to know, that he had too raſhly enterprized to come ſeek him. The Trumpet arived at the Camp of his enemy, at the ſame time that their Captain was in the midſt of them, exhorting them in general, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of what they ought to doe, and the better to move them to fight, he ſet before their eyes the treaſon of of the King, who having falſified his faith was entred into armes againſt his Prince, and Leige Lord. But ſo ſoone as he had ſeen the Trumpet, and had known the cauſe of his coming, he ſent him back with this anſwer. Trumpet, ſay to thy Maſter that if he were as well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Loialty, as he is with pride and preſumption, I ſhould account him one of the gentleſt Knights in the world: But becauſe it is impoſſible to excuſe him of his treaſon againſt his natural Prince, I have ſuch aſſurance of his threats (that with Gods help) before the houre that he ſends me, I ſhall have him at my mercy. At that time <hi>Floreſtan</hi> was preſent, when the Duke made him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and as the Trumpet was about to returne the way he came, he called him back, and ſaid to him: Trumpet, tell thy Maſter, that if the Duke had knowne my will, he ſhould have made no anſwer, for a perſon taxed with treaſon as he was, did not deſerve the ſpeech of ſo wiſe a man. And if he inquires who I am, tell him that I am called <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> a ſtrange Knight, and am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to break his pate this day, being a mortal enemy to all ſuch wicked men as he is. The Trumpet told him that he would obey his commands, and took ſpecial notice of what Coat of Armes <hi>Florestan</hi> had on, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an azure turquin colour, embroider'd with flowers of Gold. Then he made haſte away, and went to the King, to whom he faithfully related all which you have heard: at which he was ſo greatly angered, that he preſently ſent to his ſon to advance, and march forwards with the Van-guard. And ſo in leſs then an houres ſpace, the two Armles came ſo neere together, that they were within a Lance puſh, when <hi>Groter</hi> ſent a Herald to aske
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52725:26"/>for <hi>Floreſtan;</hi> who preſently appeared to know what he would have with him. Sir ſaid the Herald, <hi>Groter</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of this Troop, being the ſon of the King of <hi>Breigne,</hi> deſires to know whither or no you are endowed with as much valor at with injurious ſpeeches: and for that cauſe he earneſtly deſires, that before the two battels doe join, he and you may have one ſingle combate. My friend ſaid <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> let him then withdraw his forces as I will doe mine, and let him come ſo ſoone as he will, to finde (perhaps) that which he ſhall not hereafter looke for. So the Herald tarried not to carry this news to <hi>Groter,</hi> for which cauſe <hi>Floreſtan</hi> on the one part, and he on the other left their guards; and couching their Lances, <hi>Groter</hi> wounded <hi>Floreſtans</hi> horſe on the ſhoulder: But <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan</hi> hit him ſo lively, that piercing his Sheild and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, the Iron went into his body, that through paine he was forced to leave his ſaddle, and meaſure his length on the ground. And as he had ended his courſe, thinking to turne his horſe to performe his enterpriſe, the beaſt being very much wounded died between his legs: in ſuch manner that he found himſelfe on his feet, wherefore he ſoone laid his hand on his Sword, and coming neer to <hi>Groter,</hi> who likewiſe got on his feet, there began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them two a moſt dangerous combate. For they were gentle Knights, and of ſo good heart, that <hi>Groter</hi> ſaid to him in derition, ſo loud that many did hear him. By God Knight of the flowers, if I have as bad luck with the Sword as I have had with the Lance, I ſhall be a good man to day inſtead of a better. And this word pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſo well, that for a long time after he cauſed himſelfe to be called by that name which his enemy had given him then. Nevertheleſs he did not make him any anſwer, but laying faſt hold on his Sheild, be endeavored with utmoſt power to vanquiſh his enemy, but if he did ſo, his enemy did the like, in ſuch manner, that every body did admire how they could hold out ſo long. <hi>Groter</hi> wondred how his enemy could make ſo long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52725:26"/>wherefore lifting up his ſword, and with all his ſtrength, thinking to take his enemy at advantage; he gave him ſo great ablow, that if <hi>Floreſtan</hi> had not allayed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of it with his ſhield, his life had been in very great danger. Wherefore being determined to reveng himſelfe, he lifted up his armes, and as <hi>Groter</hi> endeavoured to pluck the ſword from the place it was entred, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> wounded him ſo deeply on the head, that he fell down dead, the blood runing downe his face: which the <hi>Breignians</hi> ſeeing, they marched directly againſt their Enemies, and ſo the two Armies joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together; nevertheleſſe <hi>Floreſtan</hi> was firſt remounted. Then began the heat of all the Battail; for there dyed on both parts, more then two thouſand men. At this firſt charge, <hi>Galuanes,</hi> and one of the Kings Conzens broke their Lanoes on one another: but <hi>Galuanes</hi> thruſt his Lance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Enemies body. The King who led the Battell, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Van-guard diſcomfited, and ready to turne their backs, he advanced with his Battell, and the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilenſa</hi> did the like, and alſo the Reare guards on both ſides. There might you have ſeene many good Knights thrown to the ground <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and as many Foot-men wounded and killed, which was a moſt pittifull thing to behold. <hi>Galuanes, Floreſtan,</hi> and <hi>Parmenir,</hi> ranged about the field, and they met not any, but they went under the edge of their Swords. The Duke of <hi>Ortilenſa</hi> and his Sonne, were not in the meane time idle, but did performe memorable deeds of Armes: And on the other ſide, the King of <hi>Breigne,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Aligne,</hi> Captaine of his Reare-guard, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well whereſoever they went, that their Armes were not idle. The Earl of <hi>Alaſtra,</hi> met the Earl of <hi>Alingas</hi> ſonne, and with one blow with his Lance, he ſent his ſoule from body; which his Father ſeeing, He, and ten Knights of his, charged on the Earle, who being encompaſſed on all ſides, was diſarmed and borne downe to the Earth. But <hi>Floreſtan</hi> came there with a good Troop, and remounted him by force, not without great ſlaughter; for there was no place throughout the whole Army where there was
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52725:27"/>more blood ſheed. The Earl of <hi>Alinge</hi> gave <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſuch a great blow, that his eyes ſparkled: of which he ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter revenged himſelfe, knocking him to the ground with one blow of a Mace. Then thoſe of the King of <hi>Breignes</hi> Party came haſtily to ſuccour him, and the Duke of <hi>Orti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſaos</hi> party came to take him Priſoner. Then the Conflict began in ſuch manner, that the Horſes were up to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorns in blood. And as theſe two Armies were thus a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the Victory, the Duke of <hi>Dardary</hi> who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Breignians</hi> all night with his Troop, ſeeing ſo fit a time to imploy himſelfe, came upon the flanck, and gave them ſuch an Alarum, that from that time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by little and little to faint. At this time the King of <hi>Breigue</hi> was joyned with the Duke of <hi>Ortilenſa,</hi> thinking to revenge the injury he had done him, calling him Traytor: but the ill fell on himſelf, and he lay there dead. For as hee traverſed throw the Battell, ſtriking on every fide, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming deeds worthy to a Prince; by fortune he met the Duke, whom he called to the Combate; the which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſed not, although he were very old.

Know then that the enterprize of the fixty ſeven Pagan Kings, upon the City and Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was divulged in ſo many places, that the King of the Giant Iſland purpoſed to be of the number: not for any ill which he wiſhed to the Emperour: but to the end that one onely Daughter which he had, might learn of <hi>Melia,</hi> part of the skill for which ſhe was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned; and therefore he would carry her thither, and preſent her to her. This Damſell of whom I ſpeake, was ſo excellent in beauty, that there was no woman in all the adjoyning Iſles that could equall her, and her name was <hi>Gradafilea.</hi> So the King of the Giant Iſland departed from his owne Country, and carryed his Daughter with him, being accompanied with two thouſand Knights, with whom he travelled ſo long, that at laſt he came to King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and <hi>Melia:</hi> of whom he was kindly welcomed; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Sorcereſſe <hi>Melia,</hi> who ſeeing the perfect beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> ſhe purpoſed to put that ſoone into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which ſhe had a long time before projected, which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52725:28"/>was the taking of <hi>Liſvart.</hi> And to come to the point, this was <hi>Gradafilea</hi> who led him from the Court of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> as you have already heard. And to ſay truely <hi>Melia</hi> could not have found ameſſenger ſo fit to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſuch treaſon. for ſhe was ſuch a one as I have told you, and as well ſpoken as any Damſell of her time: for which cauſe it was eaſie to make him believe her, and obey her. Know then that the occaſion which moved <hi>Melia</hi> to wiſh this young Prince ſo much harm was, becauſe ſhe knew for certain by her damnable and diveliſh art, that he would be the ruine of the Pagans, and a ſure Rampart to all <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus they journied ſo long together, that they arived at the Camp of the King <hi>Armato;</hi> and untill then, <hi>Liſvart</hi> did not know unto what part he was led. So the King was very joyfull at his arivall, for he had underſtood of <hi>Melia,</hi> the danger whereinto the Pagans ſhould fall if he lived. And as <hi>Gradafilea</hi> did preſent him to him; Cruell <hi>Melia</hi> being impatient, arived; who cauſed him preſently to be taken by four villaines, and putting a great chain of Iron about his neck, ſhe ſaid to him; wicked villaine, now you ſhall have the order which you deſerve; afterwards I will lodge you in a place, where I will anſwer for you when I pleaſe. <hi>Liſvart</hi> being greatly aſtoniſhed at this entertainment, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on <hi>Gradafilea</hi> with a pittifull eye, and could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare ſaying thus to her: Truly Damſell, I never thought treaſon could be harboured with ſo great beauty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are endewed; but ſeeing that diſloyalty is ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar there where it ſhould be ſtrangeſt, I will never truſt any creature where I am not better acquainted. So <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dafilea</hi> could not anſwer him one word; for ſhe was ſo much
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52725:28"/>greved at his ill uſage, that ſhe could willingly have been dead, for ſhe loved him with all her heart. Wherefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe could not ſuccour him, unleſſe it were by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, crying tenderly, ſhe caſt her ſelfe downe at the feet of <hi>Armato,</hi> and ſaid to him; Sir, I humbly entreat of you, that he who hath confided in me, may receive no injury: for you will doe me wrong, and I may juſtly be accuſed of treaſon, which never happened to any other of my Linage. But the King turned his head on one ſide, and without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, he commanded to impriſon <hi>Liſvart,</hi> and that hee ſhould be put in the furtheſt part of the Dungeon. Sir, ſaid ſhe, I will never depart from your feet, if you conſent to ſuch an out-rage; at leaſt doe me this pleaſure, that his perſon be in an honeſt place, and without being chained as a Rogue; otherwiſe aſſure your ſelfe, that I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of you all my life, and in all places whereſoever I ſhall come. And as ſhe was in theſe vehement paſſions, her Father arived, who being abaſhed to ſee his Daughter ſo ſad, and the injury which was done to him that had followed her, he was not afraid, but freely ſpake his mind; for which cauſe, <hi>Armato</hi> fearing to anger him, agreed to his Daughters requeſt, although ſaid he, this be contrary to all reaſon: for if you or ſhe ſhould know of what importance the death of this Raſcal is, you would both give judgement of death againſt him. So <hi>Liſvart</hi> was unchained, and put into a ſtrong Tower, of which <hi>Melia</hi> kept the Key: and beſides ſhe appointed thirty Knights for his guard, of which fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen watched untill mid-night, and the reſt untill day: So God give him patience and provide for him, otherwiſe his death is near, as we ſhall recite in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>But firſt know that the Gentleman ſent from the Duke of <hi>Ortilenſa</hi> to the Emperour, arived at <hi>Trebiſond.</hi> and related to him at large; the Battell that had been between his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that of the King of <hi>Breigne,</hi> and the death of Him, and his Sonne; and laſtly, the totall defeat of his Enemies. For which the Emperour greatly praiſed our Lord, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52725:29"/>for the great care which he had, he cauſed it to be often times related by the Meſſenger, even before the Ladies: and believe me, he did not forget the great deeds of Armes, and proweſſes of <hi>Floreſtan, Galuanes,</hi> and <hi>Parmenir.</hi> If then <hi>Gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what adventures then brought you in theſe Marches? Quoth <hi>Perion.</hi> No other, anſwered <hi>Talanque,</hi> but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of this Fountaine, where it is reported there doth ordinarily happen marvellous and ſtrange adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and although that it was our intention to return preſently to <hi>Galifurnus,</hi> we will not now depart ſo ſoon from you, ſeeing that God and fortune hath cauſed us to meet. I like this well, ſaid he, you will doe me a pleaſure: for I cannot depart from this place, until ſhe who brought me hither cometh againe to finde me, and ſo I have promiſed her: but ſhe being returned, I will ſo far prevaile with her, that I will follow her, or ſhe ſhall give me leave to goe with you. And as he ſpake theſe words he perceived a Hart greatly wounded, followed by a Gentleman, having a horne about his neck very richly garniſhed, and between his legs a Turkiſh horſe running marvellous ſwift. So he was cloſely followed by another Gentleman, clothed with the like habiliments: but not altogether ſo brave. Theſe two rode ſo faſt after the Hart, that they did not ſee the Knights, untill the beaſt was dead: they were in their Arbor, out of which nevertheleſs they iſſued, and mounted on horſeback, when they ſaw the firſt Gentleman alight, and draw his knife to have the head of the beaſt. And as they looked about them, the other diſcovered <hi>Perion,</hi> and the reſt of his Companie, bearing ſignes of Chriſtians on their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: wherefore he rode ſtraight to them, and the firſt to whom he addreſſed himſelfe was the Queen <hi>Calafea,</hi> to whom he cried ere he came neer: Ah good Knight! for Gods ſake pitie me and ſave me; for I am of the ſame
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52725:30"/>Law that you are of: Gentleman, anſwered the Queen, there is none in this Company, that will not willingly doe you pleaſure. The other who heard this ſpeech, lifted up his head, and ſeeing ſuch a company, left his prey: and thinking to put his feet in the ſtirrop to flie, he was held by his companion, who ſaid to him; At this time you ſhall be my Priſoner, as well as I have been yours. And as the one endeavoured to eſcape, and the other to hold him, there iſſued out of the thick wood ſix Knights armed at all points, whom eight Gentlemen without Harneſſe followed, conducting a Damſel faire in every perfection: who was accompanied with two women, mounted and furniſhed as the Daughters of great Lords, as they were. The ſix Knights ſeeing <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and thoſe of his Company at the firſt ſight that they were Chriſtians: wherefore pulling downe the viſor of their Helmets, they cryed out aloud, that they were dead. I know not ſaid he of the Sphere what may come, but God be thanked, now there is none of us ſick. And becauſe the others couched their Lances againſt them, they placed themſelves to reſiſt them, and they gave the Pagans ſuch blowes with their Lances, that they were all thrown dead to the ground at the firſt attempt: wherefore the eight that were diſarmed fled, as faſt as their horſes could run. Thus the Ladies remained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out guard, to the principal and chiefe of them <hi>Perion</hi> firſt addreſſed himſelfe, and graciouſly ſaid to her: In good faith Madam, I never obteined any Conqueſt as I know, that pleaſed me ſo well as this. Of one thing I will aſſure you, that all the priſon you ſhall have with me, it ſhall be this, that I will imploy my utmoſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to doe you ſervice, as I am accuſtomed to doe to all faire ones as reſemble you. At theſe words <hi>Tiriaxa,</hi> ſo was this Lady called, did begin to cry extreamely, and in ſighs, ſhe anſwered <hi>Perion:</hi> Alas! I know well, pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it me or no, that I am your priſoner, at which I am grieved: nevertheleſs, I have ſo good an opinion of your

Then he tooke her by the reines of her Palfrey and led her to the Arbor: but as ſhe paſſed by where the former Combate had been, ſhe ſaw the Giant and the others lie along on the graſſe, at which ſhe was ſore grieved, that ſhe cryed with a great crye, ſaying, Alas! now I eſteeme my life leſſe then I did before: when I ſaw with my eyes <hi>Brutillion</hi> the valiant, and his Knights dead, and defeated! And for Gods ſake, ſaid ſhe, to the Knight of the Sphere, recount unto me how this ill fortune hath come unto them. Madam ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> theſe are hazards, and fortunes which often happen to them that ſeek them; And then he declared to her the manner of the fight, and how it began, and what was the iſſue. And as they were in this diſcourſe, the Croſſed Knights brought with them the two Gentlemen that hunted the Hart. Then <hi>Perion</hi> leaving <hi>Tirixa</hi> with <hi>Calafea,</hi> tooke apart the eldeſt of them, and asked him what he was, and the Damſel alſo.

And you, ſaid the Knight of the Sphere, are you of their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred? no, anſwered the Gentleman, I am ſon to the King of Naples, and was not long ſince taken by <hi>Brutillion,</hi> who romes on the Sea, as I was agoing to the chaſe, in the Company of ſix of My Knights <hi>Perion.</hi> was greatly grieved, having heard the enterprize of the Pagans on <hi>Thrace:</hi> nevertheleſs he did not diſcover his grief, but went downe into the Grove with the reſt. Whether <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quefa</hi> came ſoone after, who being arived, caſt her ſelfe at the feet of <hi>Perion,</hi> to kiſſe them, but he graciouſly tooke her up, and ſaid to her: By my God, Damſel, your returne hath very much gladded me, you are very welcome. Good Knight anſwered ſhe, my Father deſires humbly to be remembred to you, as he who is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to you, then to any other living. Your father ſaid <hi>Perion?</hi> I never ſaw him as I know. Ahah! anſwered ſhe, it was the old man that was bound in the Cart, who was neere unto his death; had it not been for the good aid which he received of you: but you have delivered him from the moſt cruel torment that ever any man of his age indured. And know ſir Knight, that he by his skill foreknew all his misfortune, which he could not reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, onely by the head of one of the Sons of <hi>Amadis de Gaule:</hi> for which reaſon he commanded me to go ſeek you, and prevaile ſo far, that I might bring you hither at the day and houre as you have found him. Now you may know why I commanded you not to ſpeak in the Court of the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> fearing that by knowing you, my enterprize would be hindred, which is now effected, for which I praiſe God and you. I wonder ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> that he did not diſcover himſelfe to us. Ah ah ſir! ſaid ſhe, you ſhall ſee him another time at more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo it is that he hath commanded me to tell you, that he is gone into the Iſle of <hi>Apes',</hi> which is his own; but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52725:31"/>in what Countrey ſoever he is you ſhall finde him to be an affectionate ſervant to acknowledge the paines, that you have taken for him, and the good which he hath received by your meanes. And as for the promiſe which you have made me, it is ſo well performed, that from henceforth you may goe whither ſoever you pleaſe. Damſel anſwered <hi>Perion,</hi> if I had knowne him, I promiſe you, that for your ſake, I would have done him all the honor which he deſerves: Nevertheleſs that ſhall be an other time, when he ſhall pleaſe. And ſeeing that you give me leave, to morrow, if it pleaſe God, I will goe ſeek the Company, wherein I was when you ſaw me firſt.</p>

Then the Knight of the Sphere asked <hi>Languines</hi> and <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> what way they intended to take.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52725:32"/>be the news of the Seige continues. <hi>I</hi> aſſure you ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> I will be there, and therefore I pray doe not faile. Then they mounted on horſeback, taking their way to the Sea-ſide: but they had not gone far, when they heard a noiſe and neighing of horſes, and ſoone after they ſaw ten Knights iſſue out of the wood, being well mounted and armed, before whom marched one who was greater then any of the others, holding in his hand a great and ſtrong Lance, at the end whereof did hang a very faire and compleat ſtreamer. His armes were all black, covered with Gold and Diamonds, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faire precious ſtones: and his Countenance declared him to be a great Lord, and Captaine of all the reſt. The Knight of the Sphere had an extraordinary great deſire to know his name. The Queen <hi>Calafea</hi> had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen him, wherefore ſhe eaſily knew him, and aſſured <hi>Perion</hi> that it was <hi>Radiare</hi> great Souldan of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie:</hi> with whom ſaid ſhe, <hi>I</hi> entred the field, by reaſon of a Defiance which we ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to two of your neareſt parents, <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian.</hi> By God anſwered <hi>Perion,</hi> this makes me have the greateſt deſire to combate with him. And at that inſtant he laced his Helmet, and tooke his Lance, marching ſtrait to the other, who ſeeing him, cried out to him very loud: Knight who art arived black as <hi>I</hi> am, before you and <hi>I</hi> enter into Combate, <hi>I</hi> would intreat you to tell me your name, and of what Countrey you are of. Truly ſaid the Knight of the Sphere, you ſhall not in any wiſe be refuſed for ſo ſmall a matter: My Countrey is great Brittaine, and at this time <hi>I</hi> ſerve the faireſt Ladie in the world, and as yet I neither know her name, neither have I as yet deſerved ſo much favor for the beginning. By my head, ſaid <hi>Radiare,</hi> thou ſpeakeſt like one of a ſtout heart, and I am very glad that I have met at ſo good a time, a Knight of a Countrey of which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there comes none but valiant men, and I and mine have many times found them to be ſuch. And to the end
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52725:32"/>that you may not think my ſpeeches to be feigned, if you will follow me and be mine, I will make you captaine General of the Army which I have raiſed, to goe to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> but if you diſdaine my ſide, inſtead of ſo much good you ſhall preſently dye by my hands. See how ill it is, ſaid <hi>Perion;</hi> it may be you may have more occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to threaten me then you think for, for you cannot have a greater enemy in the world then I. Is it poſſible anſwered the Soldan, then keep your ſelfe from me if you can: nevertheleſſe you ſhall receive this courteſie at my hands, that none of my men ſhall aſſaile you, but onely one by one. Then he called him that was neereſt to him, to whom he commanded to fight with <hi>Perion,</hi> and not one jot to ſpare him: But he reckoned without his Hoſt, for at the firſt meeting the Pagan was diſarmed, and remained ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out on the graſſe, moving neither hand nor foot. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Radiare</hi> commanding another to come who was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as his fellow, and ſo were five more that followed after: At which the Soldan wondred, having brought (as he thought) the flower of Chivalry of his Country, he then commanded the eighth in whom he put much confidence, to revenge his Companions: And preſently he and the Knight of the Sphere broke upon one another, in ſuch manner that their Lances flew into peeces, and in paſſing they met together with their ſhields, bodies and heads ſo ſtrongly, that the Pagan fell downe aſtoniſhed in the place. Which the Queen <hi>Calafea</hi> ſeeing, ſhe could not forbear longing, and ſhe ſent <hi>Alquefa</hi> to carrie her Lance to <hi>Perion,</hi> praying him on her part, Seeing his owne had been ſo well imployed, that he would indeavor to doe as much with that other. <hi>Perion</hi> humbly thanked her by the Damſel, and by reaſon that the ninth Pagan was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to run, he uſed no long diſcourſe with her, but onely he ſent word by her to the Queen that he would eſteeme himſelfe one of the beſt runners with the Lance in the world, if he knew as much as ſhe had forgotten. And at this point the Pagan and he charged one another,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52725:33"/>and their Lances flew in pieces, <hi>Perion</hi> remaining on Horſe-back, and the other thrown downe ſo heavily, that hee thought he had broke his neck: wherefore the tenth came to the ſport, who did hit <hi>Perion</hi> ſo rightly, that he made him to ſtoope, but he ſoone after revenged himſelfe; for he thruſt his Lance through his body more then a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in length, and he fell downe to the ground dead, the Trunchion remaining in his Guts. This is wonderfull ſaid the Queene <hi>Calafea</hi> to <hi>Talanque.</hi> I never ſaw a fairer Juſt; I pray you ſaire Sir, ſend him alſo your Lance, to th'end that he may performe ſo glorious an enterprize. To the which <hi>Talanque</hi> agreed, wherefore ſhe called <hi>Alquefa,</hi> and ſaid to her; Damſell, returne to the Knight of the Sphere, and ſay to him, that he hath much honoured the wood wherein you have brought him, in hitting the Pagan ſo right on the belly, and that for the love of his Lady, hee would yet doe as much to this other. So <hi>Alquefa</hi> tarried not long to carry this meſſage, which ſo greatly augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the force of the Knight of the Sphere, that he aſſured the Meſſenger to employ his whole power, untill he had the Souldan his priſoner, or he would loſe his owne life in the adventure: But <hi>Radiare</hi> thought much otherwiſe, and prepared himſelfe to revenge the death of <hi>Grimante,</hi> which was the fore-named Knight that was laſt foyled, ſwearing by his great God, that <hi>Perion</hi> ſhould doe Penance for this offence. To obtaine which, he approached to him, and ſaid, Knight, I have more cauſe to hate you then any man that I know, and nevertheleſs for the great proweſs that is in you, I am conſtrained to eſteeme of you, and beare you this honour, that if you will be on my ſide, as I have not long ſince told you, I will utterly forget the evill which I owe you; and I will likewiſe doe much good for you. Truly anſwered the Knight of the Sphere, I will counſell you a great deale beteer, if you will believe me. How ſaid <hi>Radiare?</hi> Leave thy fooliſh Faith, anſwered the Knight, and acknowledge <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be alone God; not the Idolls, and Devils which abuſe you; and inſtead
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52725:33"/>of doing hurt to the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as you have enterprized, aid and helpe him with all your power, then will we be friends, and not elſe. You need not doubt whether <hi>Radiare</hi> was inflamed with Ire, as hee ſoon made the Knight of the Sphere underſtand in ſaying to him: How, doe you give counſell to thoſe that doe not aske? doe you thinke to tame me ſo? No, no, before you eſcape my hands, I hope to chaſtiſe you in ſuch ſort, that you ſhall never ſpeak ſo raſhly to a man of my quality. And nevertheleſſe before we enter into Combate, heare the Covenant that I propound to thoſe againſt whom I ſight, then if you like it, you may agree to it; if not, I leave it to your diſcretion. Say what you will ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> and I will willingly hearken to you: The vanquiſhed, ſaid <hi>Radiare,</hi> ſhall be ſlave to the vanquiſher, in ſuch manner, that he ſhall obey him in all things: Conſider then if you will conſent to it. By God, anſwered <hi>Perion,</hi> you ſpeak like a Prince of a good heart; and I love this cuſtome ſo well, that I will performe it on my part without falſifying my word. Then guard your ſelfe from me ſaid the Souldan. Then they ſeparated themſelves, and giving the Careere to their Horſes, they met ſo ſtrongly, that <hi>Radiare</hi> and his Horſe were baſt to the ground; and <hi>Perions</hi> Horſe had his ſhoulder broken; for which cauſe he ſtopped, and fell downe under his Maſter: but firſt their Lances flew in pieces. And as both their falls were ſtrange, ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved themſelves ſo lighty, as if they had not endured one blow nor buffet: and marching with great fierceneſs, they laid their hands on their ſwords; beginning a Combate ſo furious, and with ſo heavy blowes, that none ſaw them that were not aſtoniſhed: For they ſo laboured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their ſtrengths, as it ſeemed that the graſſe was dyed with their blood, and the ground covered with the broken pieces of their Armour; ſo that every one thought that their deaths was neare. And they maintained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this eſtate, without taking breath, untill it was noone, but the Souldan went on one ſide, and ſaid to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52725:34"/>Knight, I thinke that we ſhould not take example of wild beaſts, angred with one another in our Combate: but the common cuſtome of Knights that beare Armes doe uſe; therefore I pray you let us take breath, then let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin againe when you pleaſe. I am content, anſwered <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> not that I ſeeke for reſt, but you have ſhewed your ſelf ſo courteous to me, in forbidding your Knights not to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile me altogether, that I ſhall thinke the better on you the longeſt day that I live. So they remained ſtill, reſting themſelves on the pummels of their ſwords: Nevertheleſs this ſtay laſted not long, for ſoon after they recharged one another better then before; and the Souldan preſſed on <hi>Perion</hi> ſo neere, that the blood ran downe on all ſides, whereof he ſoon revenged himſelf, giving him ſuch a blow with his ſword, that it entred more then a handfull in length into his ſhield, which he cut in twaine; and as he employed all his force to pull it out, he conſtrained him to ſet his knee to the ground. Nevertheleſſe he ſoone aroſe, and in riſing, he gave the Knight of the Sphere ſo great a blow, that had it not been for the goodneſſe of Armour, he had cleaved his head in twain. Then <hi>Perion</hi> knowing the danger wherein he was, took his ſword in both his hands, and ruſhed on <hi>Radiare</hi> with all his force, in ſuch manner that both his eyes ſparkled, remaining ſo ſtunned that he began to reele, and <hi>Perion</hi> took hold of his Coller, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo heavily to the ground, that he had the meanes to take of his Helmet, and threw it away, <hi>Radiare</hi> being ſtunned, perceiving the aire, began to recover. How? ſaid the Knight of the Sphere, doth your courage faile you for ſo ſmall a matter? Where is now this glory and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of courage, for which you are ſo renowned in ſo many places? At theſe words the Souldan opened his eyes; and as he ſaw himſelfe in danger of death, and the ſword lifted up, ready to fall on his head, he anſwered him: The magnanimity whereof you ſpeak, remaines in the heart of the Souldan of <hi>Liquea,</hi> from whence it ſhall neither depart nor leſſen, for whatſoever perill may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52725:34"/>Yes, but ſaid the Knight of the Sphere, doe not you remember the Covenant ſworne between you and I? I know it, anſwered he; and I would have you to know, that if I have my carriage firme, my ſpeech is as much, or more ſtable and certaine: in ſuch manner, that I had rather loſe ten lives, if I had them, then the leaſt thing of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſhould not be executed in the leaſt point. Therefore make uſe of me as of your ſlave: for I am ready to endure whatſoever your pleaſure ſhall be. Truly ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> you doe manifeſt your ſelfe to be ſuch a one as you are renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for; ſo I will uſe you with the honeſty which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: Therefore riſe, and remount on Horſe back, and afterwards we will take of the reſt: which they did, and ſoon after the croſſed Knights approached. Then the Queen <hi>Calafea</hi> came near, and her head being bare, ſhe came to embrace the Souldan, crying to him: Seignior <hi>Radiare,</hi> ſeeing that you and I have ſo well tryed the ſtrength of the Chriſtians as you know, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> pray you aſſure your ſelfe that you can have no advantage over them, they being ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a God who is alone Maſter and Lord of all things: Likewiſe it was a folly for you to joyne your ſelfe in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with this Knight, who is brother to the Emperour <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and ſon to the moſt renowned <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> by whom you and I were vanquiſhed io the laſt ſeige of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as you may well remember. Madam, ſaid he, If I committed folly, I have dearly paid for it; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that it is a grief to me, ſo likewiſe I have great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee you in good health, remembring me as yet of the fortunes which we had together even in the laſt voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into <hi>Thrace.</hi> And by reaſon that they loſt blood which came out of the wounds of both their bodyes, before they went further, they had them bound up; and from thence, fearing the arivall of the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of the Children which they had taken, they went towards the Seaſide, where they then found the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſells in which they had taken Port, even that of <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Languines,</hi> into which the Knight of the Sphere
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52725:35"/>embarqued himſelfe. And becauſe that <hi>Alquefa</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to her Father, who ſtaid for her in the Iſle of <hi>Apes</hi> as you have heard; ſhe humbly entreated of <hi>Perion</hi> to give her leave. My great friend ſaid he, I pray God guide you: but if you will doe ſo much for me as to grant me one gift, which ſhall coſt you little, there ſhall be no day of my life wherein you ſhall not have of me a Knight ready to obey you. How? anſwered ſhe, doe you thinke that I will refuſe any thing that you ſhall pleaſe to command me? no truly, were it to adventure the greateſt part of my life. Then <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> took her apart, and they two being alone, he ſaid to her in ſighs: Ah, ah, <hi>Alquefa!</hi> I thought to have taken an other courſe, and returne towards Madam <hi>Gricilerea,</hi> to ſerve her, as ſhe to whom my heart is ſo affectionate, that thinking on her I die, and not thinking on her I cannot live! God grant then that this beginning take ſo good a concluſion as I hope for, and doe me ſo much favour that ſhe may name me hers; for teſtimony whereof, I have thought to ſend her by you the Infanta <hi>Tiriaxa,</hi> with her bother, and the Souldan of <hi>Liquea,</hi> whom I pray you to carry to her, and preſent to her on my part: for even as I am hers, it is reaſonable that thoſe things that are mine and which I have conquered ſhould ſerve her, and be hers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You ſhall tell her that my returne unto <hi>Trebiſond</hi> ſhall be the ſooneſt that I can poſſibly, and that in the mean time I hope not to ſtrike one blow with a Lance, nor to doe an act worthy a Knight, but what ſhall be for the glory and love of her. Sir, anſwered <hi>Alquefa,</hi> I will wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which you command me; and I will ſerve you with her, with ſo much loyaltie, that you ſhall perceive it. I entreat you doe it ſaid <hi>Perion.</hi> Then approaching near to the Souldan, who in the mean time diſcourſed with <hi>Tiriaxa,</hi> complaining to her, that for the deſire which he had to ſee the King her Father, he was fallen into the hands of his enemies. But the Knight of the Sphere interrupted them in their talke, cauſing them to underſtand his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: in purſuance whereof he ſaid to the Souldan, you
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52725:35"/>ſhall goe with your Knights, and you Madam with your Brother, and you women, whether this Damſell will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you, and there you ſhall be welcome for my ſake. When <hi>Tiriana</hi> heard theſe words, ſhe redoubled her teares, and ſhe ſorrowfully anſwered: Sir Knight, I am in your power, and ſo unwilling to live, that I would I were now dead. Madam, ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> I hope you wil have more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then you thinke for: And for your part Seignior <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diare,</hi> according to the promiſe which we have joyntly made together, I will (that you being arived at the place whereunto I ſend you) that you ſuddenly diſpatch two of your men, to go advertize your Subjects that none of them ſtir againſt the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but rather that they favour him in all that they can. Pardon me anſwered he, my word was obliged to another before you. You may command me whatſoever you pleaſe, but as for my faith it is more then my perſon. I have promiſed and ſworne to ſuccour the King <hi>Armato,</hi> in all and through all: and as I have told you, my life ſhall ſooner end then my faith be broken. Truly ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> and then I will not doe it, and I ſhould be very ſorry that through my occaſion the word, of ſo great a Lord, and ſo wiſe a man ſhould be falſified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But follow the Damſell, and untill I ſhall ſee you againe, I commit you to God. Then the Souldan, <hi>Tiriaxa,</hi> and the others, tooke their leaves of him, and entring into the barque of <hi>Alquefa,</hi> the Knight of the Sphere ſaid to her, I humbly entreat you Damſell, humbly to ſalute on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe the Princeſſe <hi>Onolerea,</hi> and all the other Ladies of the Court: having ſaid ſo he approached near her, and ſecretly gave her a Letter to preſent to <hi>Gricilerea.</hi> Then the wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faire, the <hi>Apes</hi> began to row, taking the beſt way for their journey.</p>

And as <hi>Perion, Abies,</hi> and <hi>Languines</hi> did reverence him, <hi>Frandalo</hi> advanced to embrace <hi>Perion;</hi> and in embracing him, hee ſaid to him: Sir Knight, I am ſo much yours, that you may command me, as he who deſires to obay you for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> your Brother, whoſe friend a very much affectionate ſervant I am. The Knight of the Sphere had never ſeen him; wherefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſaid to him, my ſonne, you may well have heard ſpeak of the Earl of <hi>Frandalo;</hi> this is he who preſents you his ſervice, and he is the very ſame to your friends, as he hath witneſſed to you. In good faith Sir, anſwered <hi>Perion,</hi> he preſents me with nothing but what he ſhall have of me when he pleaſeth, and that not without cauſe, for his great goodneſſe and proweſs is ſo known and recommended throughout the world, that he may account himſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that hath his acquaintance. By my ſoul, ſaid <hi>Frandalo,</hi> in embracing you, I may well ſay I have within my armes,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52725:36"/>the true effigies and portracture of the flower of all Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie, And this he ſaid, for aſmuch as <hi>Perion</hi> did whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſemble <hi>Eſplandian</hi> his brother, the remembrance of whom ſtruke the Emperor to the Heart, that the tears came from his eyes, and at that inſtant the Knight of the Sphere preſented unto him the Prince <hi>Adariel,</hi> ſaying to him: Sir behold the Heire of the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> who, if it ſo pleaſe God may one day doe you ſervice; The Lad ſet his knee to the ground, to kiſſe his hands: but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror graciouſly tooke him up, making him very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: then they went up into the Palace, and leading the Knight of the Sphere by the hand, he lead him towards the Empreſſe, to whom the Emperor in entring ſaid: Madam, behold your ſon returned, nothing is now want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but your daughter, who in time we ſhall have. The Knight of the Sphere made great obeyſance to her, and the Empereſſe aroſe for to kiſſe him, and in kiſſing him, ſhe ſaid to the Emperor: By my God Sir, you have done well, to bring me that thing which of all things in the world I moſt deſire to ſee, and ſo I know certainly that my ſon is enchanted, all the world together ſhall not make me believe, that this Knight is not <hi>Eſplandian.</hi> Then ſhe came to embrace <hi>Adariel, Languines,</hi> and <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and becauſe it was dinner time, the Emperor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Tables to be covered in the great hall: for he would eat in publique, for the love of the new come Knights. <hi>Frandalo</hi> was come but that ſame day, and he was ſent for the occaſion of the Pagans great preparation to returne into <hi>Thrace,</hi> for which cauſe all the Court was very ſorrowful: But that which troubled them more was, that as the laſt courſe was ſerving, a great whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde beat againſt the windowes, and ſoone after a great clap of thunder mingled with lightning, that all the Companie thought they had been buried quick: and not without cauſe: fot the darkneſſe continued for above a quarter of an houre ſo black, that the cleereſt ſighted there could not ſee the greateſt of the Companie. And as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52725:37"/>his darkneſſe vaniſhed, there appeared in the aire, in the middle of the Hall, a flaming Sword, tainted with blood, at the end whereof hung a writing of Parchment, ſealed with a great ſeale of Gold, which the Emperor cauſed preſently to be reached downe, to ſee what was therein contained.

               <p>This writing being read, every one remained abaſhed, and the ſword flew upright, remaining in the aire fixed as a true Commet. But this rumour was hardly appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when another was heard through the Towne, and it proceeded by reaſon of two Giants: who are entred even as far as the Palace: leading a Gianteſſe ſo richly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, that the Diamonds and Pearls of her Robes were uneſteemable. And ſhe had on her head a Circle of Gold, ſo well wrought, and of ſo rare workmanſhip, that it was reported the workman had been ten years in working of it, and had done nothing elſe. Theſe Giants were armed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52725:37"/>at all points, except the Head peece and Gantlets: and they were accompanied with twentie other Knights of the ſame furniture. Which being come to the Emperors knowledge, he doubted of treaſon, wherefore he and his ran haſtily to armes: and in the meane time the reſt wrapped their mantles about their armes, and holding their ſwords in their hands, they purpoſed to keep the entrance of the Palace. Where ſoone after the Giants arived, in ſuch equipage as you have heard; the ancienteſt of which gave ſigne of Peace, praying ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to conduct him before the Emperial Majeſtie, the which was done. And being arived there they ſet their knees to the ground, and the old Giant began to ſpeake in this manner. Moſt puiſſant Emperor, thoſe who know me commonly call me <hi>Argamont</hi> the valiant.

Then he declared how all happened between them. To which the Emperor tooke a ſingular great pleaſure: and they did them great Honor, and made them very welcome, eſpecially by the Knight of the Sphere and his Companions, prayſing with great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the good beginning of Knighthood, which was in <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Vaillides,</hi> of whoſe affaire they being deſirous to know further, they requeſted of the two Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to tell them where they had left them. Sirs, anſwered <hi>Argamont,</hi> aſſoone as they ſaw me out of danger, and my wounds cloſed, they prayed me to come, and attend them in this place: at that inſtant they embarqued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52725:38"/>to goe in ſearch of a Knight, for whoſe abſence they were grieved, aſſuring me nevertheleſs, that if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in foure moneths they had no tidings of him, they would without further delay come to this City, attending the Seige of the Pagan Princes: of which ſir, ſaid he, to the Emperor, you have been already advertiſed, and behold my ſon, who can tell you for certaine, as he who hath been preſent in a great Muſter and Aſſembly which they had; I have ſcarcely knowne the halfe ſaid the Emperor, I pray God help me. And in ſaying thus the tears fell from his eyes, for he much doubted the threats of <hi>Melia:</hi> For aſmuch as the writing contained the ignominious death of the perſon which he loved beſt in the world. He well knew the Enchantment as well of his ſon as of his Daughter, and therefore he feared that this injurie would fall upon <hi>Liſvart,</hi> whom he thought to be ſafer then in the hands of the Enchantreſſe: but he was deceived, as you have formerly heard. So the Giants and their traine were magnificently received, and the Emperor gave them faire preſents, even having underſtood of <hi>Argamont</hi> that he would not depart from thence ſo long as he ſhould have need of them, but that they would faithfully ſerve him, according to what they had ſworne to <hi>Vaillides</hi> and <hi>Quedragant.</hi> And as they were in this diſcourſe, news came by a Scout, that without doubt the Pagans were already aſſembled in great Companies in the Iſle of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedos,</hi> and purpoſed to diſlodge about the end of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing month, for which cauſe the Emperor called his Councell, where it was concluded, that Meſſengers ſhould be diſpatched, ſome to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Scicilia</hi> (and in their paſſage they ſhould informe the King of <hi>Naples, Adarials</hi> father, the good fortune of his ſon) and others towards the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Kings of Spaine, of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and of great Britaine. Then from thence to <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant,</hi> and to the Kings <hi>Cildadan,</hi> and of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe them of the great enterprize of the King <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:</hi> and to intreat them for Gods ſake, to ſend them the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52725:38"/>greateſt Companie of great Veſſels that they can poſſible to ſuccour <hi>Thrace,</hi> which otherwiſe would be ruined. And by reaſon that this voyage would be long, it was thought fit, that in the meane time, that <hi>Frandalo</hi> ſhould retire to the Port of the defended Mountaine, and with the King <hi>Norandell,</hi> who ordinarily ſtaid there, they ſhould ſtop (if they could poſſible) all Merchants ſhips or others: to the end that they might hinder their enemies from victuals, if they ſhould march forward without forcing the places. And that the Emperor ſhould remaine in the City, attending the news of the other Chriſtian Princes, to whom Meſſengers were ſent, who were embarqued that very day; and with pitifull Letters, aſwell of the Emperor, as of the Knight of the Sphere; <hi>Languinea Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others, they made ſuch diligence, that their legation had the fruit, as you ſhall heare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

In good faith anſwered the others, we will doe it truly, and we will ſtay untill the day be come. That will be to morrow, ſaid <hi>Talanque,</hi> therefore reſt your ſelfe for to day, that you may be the freſher about your buſineſs. And ſo at that time they would enterprize nothing, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the time to fight, they ſpent the time in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of the skirmiſhes and aſſaults which they had given the Town, during the Seige, until the next morning: when a Trumpetter brought the Hoſtages from the King of <hi>Sibernea.</hi> For which cauſe, after the oathes and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in ſuch caſes obſerved on both ſides, thoſe who were appointed to fight, entred into the field, and the King addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Perion,</hi> whom he met in ſuch manner, that without the helpe of his horſe neck, he had been on the ground.

                  </gap>e with great celerity, and laying hands on their ſwords, there began between them a hard and cruel battel. It is very true, that the King of <hi>Sibernea,</hi> and one of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, forced <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Garinter,</hi> otherwiſe they would have cut their horſes bridles: and their skirmiſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſo long, that by the ſpace of foure houres, it could not be diſcerned, who would have the better or the worſe. For the King of <hi>Sibernea</hi> had given ſuch blowes to <hi>Perion,</hi> that making fire come from his eyes, he was forced to ſet his knee twice to the ground, at which he was ſo animated, that taking his ſword in both his hands, he hit the King between the neck and the ſhoulders, where he wounded him ſo ſoarely, that he never after ſtirred, but died. <hi>Talanque</hi> on the other ſide did not ſleep, but fought couragiouſly with his enemy: and he was ſo much favored of fortune, that finding the joint of the Gantled, he gave ſuch a blow, that he ſeparated his hand from his Arme. Then through paine he gave a great crie, and thinking to have recourſe to a ſwift ſlight to ſave his life, he turned his back which gained him but little, for he was thrown down by his enemy, and ſhamefully put to death. Which <hi>Garinter</hi> ſeeing, he received ſo much ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that with one blow he cut the naile and armor of him who had ſo long reſiſted him: and the ſword entring three foot into his body, he gave up the ghoſt. And the like happened to the fourth, againſt whom <hi>Manely</hi> had much to doe: for he cut off his head moſt bravely. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how it happened to the King of <hi>Sibernea</hi> and his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, who lying dead on the field, <hi>Garinter</hi> and his Companions retired into their Tents, leaving the cries,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52725:40"/>and complaints to thoſe who were thereby endamaged, as well for the loſſe of their friends, as of their towne, which was rendred, and put into the power of <hi>Perion,</hi> according to the ſworne agreements. And the day after by the advice of all, <hi>Garinter</hi> remained crowned King, to which charge, nevertheleſs he left <hi>Polinas</hi> for Governor, that he might follow ſtrange adventures when he pleaſed. Wherefore ſo ſoone as he had received the homages and oathes of fidelity of his Subjects, leaving good Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons where there was need, and <hi>Polinas</hi> for Vice-Roy, he returned with his Companions into the Iſle of <hi>Californus,</hi> where the Queen made them welcome. But they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed there but a few dayes: For ſo ſoone as they had, men and veſſels, to goe to the ſuccour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> they went to embarque themſelves. So we will leave them in the keeping of our Lord, and we will returne to the Duke of <hi>Ortilenſa,</hi> who being exceeding joyfull of ſo fair a Conqueſt, as he had had over the King of <hi>Breigne,</hi> tooke his way to <hi>Trebiſond.</hi>

And the Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the reſt were ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge, at the time that they had knowledge, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Armato</hi> might goe into Thrace. For this cauſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into their Veſſels, according to the Region and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate from when they diſpatched, traverſing ſo many Seas, that at laſt (not without great travell) they met in the Defended Mountaine, where they waited for the Earle of <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Morandell,</hi> with their equipage. At this very time, the King <hi>Armato</hi> accompanied with <hi>Almirin,</hi> brother to the Souldan of <hi>Liquie,</hi> the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans of <hi>Perſia,</hi> of <hi>Alapa,</hi> of <hi>Babilon,</hi> the Califs of <hi>Egypt, Taborlanes,</hi> and many other great Lords of the Eaſt, parted from <hi>Tenedos</hi> with ſo great a number of Ships, <hi>Brigantines, Galeaces, Gallies,</hi> and <hi>Foiſts,</hi> that the Sea ſeemed to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But they found not the Emperour ſo unaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but he had thirty thouſand Horſemen, and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand bearing Armes Nevertheleſſe he ſeeing ſo great a number of his Enemies to approach ſo near to the great City, and not having had any news of them from whom he expected aid, he was ſomewhat grieved, which he hid: and the better to aſſure his men, he was of advice that they ſhould (as much as they could poſſible) hinder the King <hi>Armatoes</hi> Army from Landing, giving them continuall Alarumes to vex and trouble them. For which purpoſe were appointed the Knight of the Sphere, <hi>Languines, Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland, Argamont,</hi> and his Sonne, with ten thouſand Horſemen, and two thouſand choſen Souldiers. Who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had notice of the place where the King <hi>Armato</hi> would take Land, they iſſued out in good equipage, and the ſame day they diſcovered the Vanguard of the Pagans, with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52725:43"/>the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> accompanied with three Giants' Brothers to him whom the Knight of the Sphere had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the Fountaine, where he had delivered <hi>Alquif</hi> the Damſells Father. So the Chriſtians remained cloſe and in ambuſh, to ſee the countenance of the ochers; but they made there no long ſtay, before they ſaw the Pagans Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels by little and little to approach the Land, and laſtly to throw Planks, and deſcend into Cock-boats, Skiffes, and other little Boats, wherby they might Land their men. I doe believe that thoſe who were the moſt diligent, were not the beſtuſed; for <hi>Perion</hi> and his company ranne upon them, and defeited a great many, before they could be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, and untill their battail and Rear-guard could joyne together, and with full ſaile gained the ſhore, in ſuch manner that <hi>Perion</hi> and his company were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and cloſe themſelves, untill the three Giants with a great band of <hi>Paleſtines,</hi> ruſhed on them with ſo much boldneſs, that he who had ſeen them, would have judged no otherwiſe, but that they had a deſire to performe their utmoſt.

Wherefore, he (as a wiſe and adviſed Captaine) began from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards to retire, nevertheleſs they ſuſtained the heat of the skirmiſh: which the Califfe of <hi>Egypt</hi> underſtanding, re-advanced, and entering further in the preſs then he ſhould, he was met by <hi>Perion,</hi> who gave him ſuch a blow on the head, that he ſeparated his head in twaine. For which, one of the King of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Giants that followed him, was ſo angred, that he lifted up his ſword with both his hands, thinking to give <hi>Perion</hi> the like payment; But <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamont</hi> ſaw the blow comming, ſet his ſhield before him,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52725:44"/>which entered into it above a foot and a halfe. Surely this force was eſteemed marvellous among others: for <hi>Argamonts</hi> ſhield was of fine ſteele, and nevertheleſſe it was cut as it were in half; and as the Giant aſſayed to pull out his ſword, <hi>Argamont</hi> gave him ſo great a blow with an Iron Crow which he had, that he bowed his head to his ſaddle, and in riſing, <hi>Perion</hi> ſeparated his ſhoulders from his ſides, of which he dyed. When <hi>Golfon</hi> his brother ſaw him in ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never was wild Boar ſo mad with Dogs, and he ſoone made <hi>Argamont</hi> underſtand it, for he ſought for him out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all: and at his arivall, he gave him ſo many blows with his Mace, that without the helpe of his Sonne <hi>Ardadile Canile,</hi> he had loſt his life: but be tooke <hi>Golfon</hi> at an advantage, and he thruſt his ſword through his body. What will you that I ſay? God did well declare this day, that he would aid the Chriſtians: and it was ſo to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, how any one of them could eſcape, they being encompaſſed with the whole power of the Pagans. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe they found meanes to ſave themſelves, and retreat with their honours unto the very walls of the City. There <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland, Languines</hi> triumphed; for although they were wounded, yet they did as great Deeds of Armes, as any Knights could doe, and great part of the honour of ſo faire a retreat, might (without injuring the others) bee attributed to them. The Pagans having then purſued the Knight of the Sphere, and his company even to the trenches of the Town; they had ſo many darts thrown at them by thoſe that were within, that they were forced to retreat, without daring to paſſe any further; and by this meanes, the Chriſtians might enter with eaſe, not without great loſſe: for there was killed twelve or fifteen thouſand on their ſide, and more then twenty thouſand of the others. Then the Gates were preſently rammed up, and a ſtrick watch was ſet in all parts: and that ſame day the enemies encamped on the Sea ſhore, leave the Kings of <hi>Rabie</hi> and <hi>Galoffe,</hi> for Captaines of their Army on the Sea; with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary equipage. And the night following they began to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52725:44"/>draw near to the Towne, and fortifie their Camp; in the middeſt whereof <hi>Melia</hi> commanded to erect her Tents and Pavillions, and next to her were thoſe of the King of <hi>Giants</hi> Iſland, and <hi>Gradafilea</hi> his Daughter, who had been to fetch <hi>Liſvart</hi> out of <hi>Trebiſond</hi> as you have heard. During theſe tranſactions, the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the befeiged did continually labour, expecting every hour the battery of the place, and the aſſault thereof: but that was not ſo ſoone as they thought: for <hi>Melia</hi> (without whoſe counſell nothing was enterprized) willed that thoſe who had wearied themſelves on the Sea, ſhould firſt refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and in the meane time ſhee commanded a great number of double Ladders to be made, to mount the Walls withall, when ſhe ſhould find opportunity, And although this was one of the occaſions, why the aſſault of the Town was ſo long delayed, yet there was one greaten. The vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous woman would have <hi>Liſvart</hi> burnt before all: for ſhe knew by her deviliſh act, that ſo long as he lived, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> would be invicible: which ſhee declared to the chiefe of the Anmy: but ſhe purpoſed, God prevented it otherwiſe, as you ſhall heare.</p>

My impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not ſo much grieve me, as to ſee my friends ſo ſtreightned, and I not having the power to help them. In good faith, ſaid ſhe, you ſhall pardon me. It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that I brought you from <hi>Trebiſond;</hi> but did not know of the ill you were to ſuffer, and have ſince ſuffered: and to make it appeare for truth, if you will grant me one boone at any time that I ſhall aske it of you, I will uſe my utmoſt indeavour to releaſe you. Madam, ſaid <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vart,</hi> I will denie you nothing if I may have my liberty. Then ſaid ſhe, ariſe, and put on the clothes which this woman ſhall give you, and follow me, but be ſure that you doe not forget your owne clothes to put them on when you ſhall have occaſion. <hi>Liſvart</hi> performed her will, and in the meane time <hi>Gradafilea</hi> watched leaſt any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould come: Great part of the night was ſpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Liſvart</hi> and his guide were ready, but a little before day, they left the Pavilion ſecretly: and paſſing through the watch, one who was more watchful then the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded who was there. I ſaid, <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> The watch who knew her gave her the good morrow, and ſo they paſſed on until they came to the Trenches, where ſhe was againe ſtopped; but ſhe was not much hindred, for the watch reverenced her, and asked her if ſhe would

And returning back, <hi>Liſoart</hi> paſſed on, until he came to the Citie Gates, where the Centinel diſcovered him, and cried out aloud to him: Who goes there at this houre, returne or I will make you. Friend, ſaid <hi>Liſvart, I</hi> pray open the gate, for I am ſuch a perſon that the Emperor will be glad of my returne: The watchman knew well that he was his Country-man, and therefore he ſpake more mildely to him then he did the firſt time: Saying to him, it is impoſſible to let you in untill it be day: for the Knight of the Sphere, who is Captaine of this Company hath the Key. And I am ſure he will not deliver it to any man unleſs he comes himſelfe: and it is too ſoone to awake him. I pray thee friend, ſaid <hi>Liſvart,</hi> tell me who this Knight of the Sphere is. The Centinell being wearied with ſo long diſcourſe, ſnapt him up and bid him goe walke abroad. Upon theſe ſpeeches a Captain of the band came, and demanded of the Centinel what was the matter: Captaine ſaid he, there is a man who would come in, but if pleaſe you, I will ſet him away. At theſe

Captaine, anſwered <hi>Liſvart,</hi> if the Emperor knew of my arival, he would be more joyfull then you thinke for. I pray you (out of curteſie) goe tell him that I have brought him news that will much content him. When the Captaine had taken ſome notice of <hi>Liſvarts</hi> ſpeech, he began to remember him; for he in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger years had been brought up neer the Emperor: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not forbear, but he ſaid aloud to him.

Ah, ah, ah Sir! ſaid the watch, ſtay a little, I will but onely goe and come. And ſaying ſo, he ran to the Knight of the Sphere, whom he found aſleep, but he awakened him, and ſaid to him: Sir, your Nephew is juſt now come to the foot of the wall, and deſires the Gate to be opened. How? anſwered the Knight of the Sphere, my Nephew? I think you dreame. Sir, ſaid the Captaine, I know him by his ſpeech, it is he without doubt.

Then ſhe told him what ſhe had done, nevertheleſs ſhe hid from him the principal occaſion, why ſhe had done it: and told him, that for her life ſhe would not have had him to have ſuffered, ſeeing that ſhe brought him from <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> under a faire ſhadow. The King was ſo angred and vexed, that he was readie to come out of his bed to have killed her, and that not without cauſe; for by this meanes the enterprize of ſo many Lords upon <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was broken, and he had likewiſe engaged himſelfe to deliver him up, whenſoever he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at his hands. <hi>Gradafilea</hi> ſeeing him ſo angred, had no other means but onely to fall at his feet on her knees, and ask him pardon; for ſaid ſhe, he not deſerving death I am readie to die for it if you ſhall think fit. Ah ah! ſaid the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52725:47"/>King, you have undone me, for ſo ſoone as <hi>Armato</hi> ſhall know of it, he hath good reaſon to take away my meanes and my life alſo! Sir ſaid ſhe, <hi>Armato</hi> ſhall know that you are in no fault, but that it was I alone, as I will confeſs to him, and let him do to me what he thinke good. And ſhe knew ſo well how to appeaſe her fathers anger, that he held his peace, and aroſe and went to <hi>Armatoes</hi> tent, and awaked him to tell him of the folly of his daughter. And as he gave him the good morrow, <hi>Armato</hi> asked him what good news he brought him ſo ſoon. Ah ſir, ſaid he, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what misfortunes? How ſaid <hi>Armato?</hi> So the King told him of the loſs of <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and the whole enterprize of <hi>Gradafilea.</hi> Oh yee Gods! cryed <hi>Armato,</hi> have I ſo highly offended you, that I deſerve ſo great a puniſhment? then in great choller he commanded the King to flie from his preſence; for ſaid he, there ſhall none of you depart this Country without ſuffering death, and perpetuall cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie. <hi>Armato</hi> cryed ſo loud, that <hi>Melia</hi> who was lodged in the next Pavillion heard the noiſe: wherefore ſhe aroſe in her ſmock, and went to the King who was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed: but ſhe was more when ſhe underſtood the cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe having knowne of <hi>Liſvarts</hi> flight, began to tear her haire, and her ſmock and her very fleſh. This noiſe being heard of ſome, and they thinking their enemies had ſurprized them, they cried the Alarnm, that on a ſuddain all the field was in armes. So the Souldans of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Alapa</hi> came to <hi>Armato,</hi> to know what was the matter: and when they knew the cauſe, as wiſe men by fair ſpeeches they found the meanes to appeaſe <hi>Armato</hi> and <hi>Melia:</hi> telling them that they might be the cauſe of frightning the whole Army. For ſaid theſe Lords, ſeeing that it is the pleaſure of our Gods, what will you doe? will you contend with Jupiter? doe you think he will doe any thing but for our good? and it may be we have offended him. Therefore let us goe to him, and appeaſe him with our prayers, and not anger him more. You may ſay what you pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato:</hi> but the Rogue that had the keeping of him ſhall die,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52725:48"/>and alſo ſhe that conducted him. Sir, ſaid the Souldan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> you have to deal with men, he is come without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie, or ſending for from a far Country, and hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelfe, as every one knowes, it may be when he hath been heard to ſpeak, he will be found more innocent then you thinke for, therefore let him be heard, then if he hath offended, he may be puniſhed by the advice of the Princes of this Camp, and it may be of his own men. Theſe Lords of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Alapa</hi> did ſo much that they ſomewhat appeaſed the King <hi>Armato</hi> and <hi>Melia,</hi> And in the meane time the Camp continued in forme of Battel, whereupon it happened, that they who went the Rounds on the City walls heard the noiſe of the Trumpets in the aire. It was as then but at the point of day, wherefore doubting they ſhould be ſurprized, and that the enemies would ſtorme the place, they ſuddenly advertiſed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, the Knight of the Sphere, and the principal Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who ran haſtily to their charge, and remained there untill Sun-riſing, when they ſaw the Pagans retire. The Emperor did not then know any thing of the returne of his Son: but ſoon after <hi>Perion</hi> brought him to him, and with a grace ſaid to him in preſenting him: Sir, the laſt night I took this Spie, what is your pleaſure ſhall be done with him? You may well imagine if the good Prince were well pleaſed: for the tears fell from his eyes in imbracing him. During theſe paſſages, <hi>Languines</hi> and <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> came, who imbraced him, and asked him what good Angel had brought him thither. Then the Emperor asked of him how he came thither, and from whence he came. Then <hi>Liſvart</hi> recited to him his whole paſſed fortunes ſince <hi>Gradafilea</hi> carried him from <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> untill that preſent, and ſaid he, the Alarum which you have heard hath been onely for my loſs.

And kiſſing him a thouſand times, ſhe would not ſuffer him to goe out of her ſight untill it was dinner time, and then he related to them all that which had happened in the Army of the Pagans, and part of their Counſels. And ſo falling from one diſcourſe to another, the Tables being withdrawn, he ſpake to <hi>Perion,</hi> ſaying: Sir, my Unckle and I departed from this Country (as it is well knowne) to goe in ſearch of you who was reported to be loſt. And my chiefeſt purpoſe was to be made Knight at your hands, not knowing of whom better to have the ſame, you being brother to my Father, and Son to my Grandfather <hi>Amadis.</hi> Therefore let me intreat you to let me obteine this honour at your hands to morrow, and that without the City Gates, that thereby the enemies may ſee it, and of which they will be very ſad.

And the Emperor kept onely twentie thouſand men for his own Guard: then he cauſed the Gate to be opened, and cloſe to it was erected a high Theatre, upon which he aſcended, with <hi>Liſvart,</hi> the Knight of the Sphere, and <hi>Argamont:</hi> and the Ladies ſtand upon the wall, where they could ſee all that was done.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Pagans being abaſhed, and that not without cauſe, having ſeen ſo many ſtrange adventures in ſo ſhort a time, could not tell what to think, eſpecially when they heard of the death of the Enchantreſs <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi> The news of whoſe ſhamefull death being come to the knowledge of <hi>Armato</hi> (by the meanes of a Grecian Spie) did ſo much ſtir him up to wrath, that he ſwore he would never depart from the City untill he had raced it, and put all within it to the edge of the ſword. At laſt the Captains of the Army to appeaſe him, promiſed to aſſaile it on the morrow morning, and to take it, or elſe to leave their lives there in the place, and to that end they made their intent knowne to the Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that every one might be ready with ladders and other neceſſaries to fill up the trenches, and likewiſe their pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers to undermine the walls, that they might enter in on foot. The King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Company of three Taborlaves, and a hundred thouſand men had the charge of the firſt on ſet; having for his aid the Souldans of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Alape,</hi> if he ſhould be repulſed. And for the third on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet was the King <hi>Armato</hi> in perſon, with ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Tures, that the earth was in a manner covered therewith. And for the Sea, word was likewiſe ſent to the Kings of <hi>Bugie</hi> and <hi>Giloffe,</hi> that ſo ſoone as they ſhould hear the ſound of their Trumpets, then they ſhould aſſault the Port, and uſe their utmoſt endeavor to force the town on that part. The Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> knowing of this purpoſe, ſoone made it knowne to his Captaines, to the end that they might be in a readineſs to doe their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52725:51"/>deavors. <hi>Liſvart</hi> was not come to him ſelfe untill then, but then he began to ſpeak, and news was carried to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who came to him to know how he did. Very well ſir, anſwered he, although for a time the noiſe of the great thunder hath made me looſe my underſtanding. I do not know ſaid the Emperor, but I think, you alwayes thinke you are a fighting, for you would by no meanes let goe the ſword which you have conquered. By my faith ſaid <hi>Liſvart,</hi> I neither thought of peace or war, nor ſcarce of my ſelfe. Truly ſaid the Emperor, there is no man living ever heard of the conqueſt of a ſword ſo ſtrangely as this which you have, and behold! here is the Scabbord and belt. One thing diſpleaſeth me much, which is to think that you are not able to approve your ſelfe againſt your enemies, who intend to come viſit us to morrow morning. How ſaid <hi>Laſvart,</hi> doe you think me to be ſo weak? No (with Gods help) I ſhall make them know, that I am as well as ever I was, and thereupon he preſently aroſe. Then the Emperor ſaid to him. My Son, the Knight of the Sphere, you and <hi>Argamont</hi> with their Troop, ſhall have the guard of the Dragons gate, which is the weakeſt place of all, the King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> and the Earl <hi>Salader,</hi> that of the Eagle, accompanied with the Prince of <hi>Brandalie, Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland, Languines,</hi> and <hi>Ardadile Cainle,</hi> for that place is almoſt as weak as the other. And yee ſhall have both ten thouſand men a peece, to ſallie out upon them, if you ſhall finde it requiſite. And I with a good number will remaine in the higheſt place of the City, to ſuccour thoſe that ſhall have moſt need, and I will likewiſe place the women, and thoſe of leaſt defence to carrie oile, boiling water, ſtones, pitch, Sulphur, brimſtone, and all manner of timber to hinder the enemies entrance. Sir, ſaid <hi>Argamont,</hi> it is requiſite that ſome may ſtand neer the walls, readie to make up the breaches in the walls, that they ſhall make, as they intend, but I will by Gods help doe ſo much, that they ſhall not eſcape ſo well as they think for: for I will tell you how I will doe; ſo ſoon as I know at what place
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52725:51"/>they intend to enter, I will make a trench juſt againſt the place, which ſhall be filled with faggots, Sulphur, Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeter, and pitch, and ſo I will give fire to it ſo ſoon as they ſhall enter upon it. Thus they all conſulted on what they would doe on the morrow, and at that night they placed a ſtrict watch. So about the break of day, they who were to ſtorme the place, having double ladders, departed every one with his bundle out of their trenches, and they made ſuch a cry, that they were heard three miles about, and ſo they ran ſtraight to the wall, and placed their Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in ſo many places, that they almoſt ſurprized thoſe within; for they had ſoone made a breach ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at, but before they got it, the trenches was almoſt filled with dead Pagans, nevertheleſs they being covered with their ſhields, and their ſwords in their hands, they ran to the Combate. Thus they gave the aſſault in two ſundrie places, and the firſt and the ſtrongeſt was where <hi>Liſvart</hi> was, and where <hi>Argamont</hi> had done what he intended &amp; thereby there was cut off about ſix thouſand, at which the reſt being frightned, fall back as faſt as they had formerly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which <hi>Liſvart</hi> ſeeing, he iſſued out at a falſe gate, with a certaine number of the moſt valiant, and fell upon the rear of them; ſo that the ſtouteſt of them loſt heart, giving ſuch fear to the whole Army, that they who aſſailed the part where the Prince <hi>Brandalie</hi> was fled, and were routed. But <hi>Armato</hi> came with his ſquadron, who made them turne their faces, though againſt their wills; and in the meane time, they who had iſſued out of the Town re-entered, and that without the loſſe of ten men. <hi>Armato</hi> then being much animated with courage, purpoſed to revenge himſelfe, and with ten hundred thouſand Turks which accompanied him, gave ſo ſtrong an aſſault to the breach where <hi>Perion</hi> was, that he had well nigh carryed it; but the Emperour came with ſo good aid, that the Combate laſted without breathing, for the ſpace of three hours. There <hi>Liſvart</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe in his colours, for he ſtroke not any Turke or Pagan, but he killed him. There triumphed the Knight of

Nevertheles he was ſuccoured by one of his Giants, who purpoſing to kill <hi>Liſvart,</hi> took his ſword in both his hands to ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore he ſoon revenged himſelfe: for he ſtruck him who had ſo hurt him, and with one back blow he cut off halfe his neck, and caſt him dead at his feet. At which the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſo grieved, that he ventured into the preſſe, and ſeeing <hi>Perion</hi> (being the man that he hated moſt in all the World) he ſet upon him on his back, and he reeeived three great blowes before he could turne his face. And in ſetting on him, he cryed, Raſcall, through your meanes my Children are impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but I will ſoon be revenged of you, for you ſhall die without remedy, and that preſently. So <hi>Perion</hi> knew then, who it was that he dealt with, wherefore he ranne upon him, and at his arivall, ſtruck him on the back ſo ſtrongly, that his eyes dazeled, and he ſtaggered ready to fall. Thus the Pagans and Chriſtians handled one another, a great number whereof lay dead, as well without the walls as within; for the aſſault hourly encreaſed, but it was well aſſayled, and well defended, in ſuch manner that the King was thrice repulſed, and he recharged them three times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new. Yet he knew that it was a folly for him to ſtrive with his fortune at that place, therefore he commanded them to retreat; and he commanded the Archers to ſhoot continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.

Alas! who would ever have thought, that I ſhould ſee ſuch an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie houre before I die? Sir, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> he who never
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52725:57"/>forgets thoſe that truſt in him, well knew what would be neceſſary both for you and us: and for this reaſon hath delivered us out of darkneſſe, to come to revenge you of this moſt curſed people, who hath done you ſo much wrong. Then <hi>Oriana</hi> ſet forward, to ſalute the Emperor, who kiſſed her very graciouſly, and in kiſſing her, ſaid to her: by my faith Madam, I now well know, that I was never more happy then now I am, having ſo ſure and good a ſuccour as yours. Sir replyed ſhe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering your great goodneſſe, we women ought to bear armes, as well as men, and come to ſuccour you. So the Emperor held her no longer in diſcourſe for that time becauſe the other Kings, Princes, Ladies, and Damſels of the company approached to doe him reverence: and in the meane while the Knight of the Sphere, and <hi>Liſvart,</hi> who went not forth of the City ſo ſoon as the Emperor: but being informed that the Chriſtians were landed, they came with their ſwords as yet bloody, to ſee if they knew any one of the company: and at the very firſt ſight they found them of the Firme Iſland, who had been ſo many years bound in the Caſtle of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> by the force of <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandas</hi> Conjurations. Then the two Knights, <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Liſvart</hi> went forward, giving great reverence to <hi>Amadis,</hi> deſiring to kiſſe his hand. Now he knew them not at firſt ſight, neither did <hi>Eſplandian, Oriana,</hi> and much leſſe <hi>Leonorina,</hi> at which the old Emperor could not hold from laughing, asking them, if that they had never ſeen them. God take me, Sir, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> not that I know: yet ſo it is, that to ſee their coats of maile painted of ſuch a colour, it gives good proofe and teſtimony that they are both bold and valiant Warriours. So they are truly, ſaid the Emperor, and ſons of the moſt valianteſt men in the world: and doe you know them? this (pointing at <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi>) is ſon of the Knight of the green ſword, who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore conquered the <hi>Endriague:</hi> and is my daughter <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norina</hi> mother to this other?

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52725:58"/>with too great delight, the teares fell from their eyes, which the Emperor ſeeing, ſaid to them with a good grace: by my ſoule Ladies, their preſence hath done ſo much ſervice here, that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> might be called happy for having them for her defence: and I more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate for the company and ſuccour which they have done me at ſo good a time: for it is moſt certain (ſeeing mine old age) that I could not have had the ſtrength that is requiſite, to ſuſtaine the miſeries and woes which have hapned to me, ſince the day that you did depart from me, and I tooke upon me the Government of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in the abſence of my ſon <hi>Eſplandian;</hi> This good old man was as yet armed, and had not left of one peece of his harneſſe, for he was in fear, leaſt the Pagans ſhould begin ſome new enterprize againſt the City: and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was bloudy ſince the fight in the morning.

Sir, <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſaid he, they are not ſo far off, but that they may come to ſee us, it may be before night: But ſeeing that God hath had ſo much remembrance of me, as to bring you hither, I hope the misfortune will fall on them; eſpecially being accompanied with theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (ſaid he, imbracing the Queen <hi>Briolania,</hi> and the other Ladies) who are ſufficient to chaſe the devils out of this world if they ſhould come out of hell to inhabit here Ah, ah ſir! ſaid ſhe, if thoſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52725:59"/>our Lord forgot you not, having brought them at ſuch opportune a time. Truly I believe it, anſwered the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. So this good old man received them one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſhewing them all the honour that they deſerved: and even to <hi>Gandalin,</hi> the Damſel of <hi>Denmarke, Carmelle,</hi> Mr <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> yea and <hi>Ardam:</hi> but he being amongſt them was ſo little, that the Emperour ſaw him not, when the Dwarfe came to pluck him by the Cloak, ſaying to him. Sir, I am come to be at your ſervice as well as the others, wherefore ſhall not I be imbraced as well as they? by my head, ſaid the Emperour, <hi>Ardan</hi> my friend, there is no good reaſon for it: but thou appeareſt ſo little ſo tall perſonages that I could not ſee thee. Sir, ſaid the Dwarfe, I have a little body, but I have an unmeaſurable deſire to doe you ſervice, who will neve hide himſelfe in any place, were it among the greateſt Giants in the world. The grace that the Dwarfe ſpake theſe words with, and as it were in a choler, cauſed every one to laugh: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this diſcourſe, <hi>Alquefa</hi> cauſed many horſes and hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to be taken out of her Veſſel: then addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Knight of the Sphere, ſhe ſaid to him, Sir Knight, my Father your humble ſervant hath ſent you theſe horſes, and prayeth you to diſtribute them as well to the King your Father, as to Madam <hi>Oriana,</hi> and others, who kept company with them ſo long in the chamber of <hi>Apolidon.</hi> So <hi>Perion</hi> quickly knew her, wherefore he imbraced her, and made her welcome: not onely for her Fathers gifts, but for the hope that he had that ſhe brought him news from her, whom he could not forget neither day nor night: Nevertheleſs, the Damſel as wiſe and well adviſed, diſſembled for that time what ſhe thought: then <hi>Perion</hi> anſwered her: Damſel, my friend, it is not the firſt courteſie that I have received of the hands of ſage <hi>Alquefa:</hi> but if God willing, I ſhall have opportunity to doe him ſome good ſervice. Sir ſaid ſhe, he hath provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Knights with armes, which I have given them before their imbarquing, and now he perhaps (as I have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52725:59"/>ſaid) that you give to each one of them one of theſe horſes, eſpecially to theſe Ladies, to whoſe good graces he now humbly recommends himſelfe. Sir, ſaid <hi>Perion</hi> to <hi>Amadis;</hi> you heare the requeſt of this Damſel: ought I to deny her? oh no! to deny? anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> therein you ſhould doe her wrong, and <hi>Alquif</hi> alſo, who have wiſhed us ſo well: ſeeing that it is ſo, ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the preſent that he hath ſent you, and let Madam <hi>Oriana</hi> have as many for her Ladies: to which they both agreed: and immediately <hi>Alquif</hi> drew forth of a Cheſt, (which two Eſquires carried on their ſhoulders) a tent of an Ineſtimable value, which ſhe preſented to <hi>Liſvart,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: moſt happie Knight, and more fortunate then any that hath been heretofore, my Father ſaluteth you in all humility, and hath ſent you this tent, being the faireſt in all <hi>Afia,</hi> in which he intreateth you to lodge (as long as this warr ſhall laſt) with King <hi>Amadis</hi> your Father, and theſe other Lords, who were inchanted in the Firme Iſland with him.

Wherefore he ſaid to him with the teares in his eyes; I know not Sir by what meanes to acknowledge the paines that you have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52725:60"/>taken to come hither, to help this poore old creature out of miſery, aſſaulted on all ſides, and in a manner ready to fall to ruine, and in the greateſt miſery that ever was diſinherited Prince. By my God, your preſence ſo much delighteth me, that I may this day call my ſelfe the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man in the world, or that was borne of a woman. Ah ſir, my brother, ſaid the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> I have done but my duty: for we are naturally bound to help each other, and your ſo much renowned goodneſſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth all Princes that are able to help you, principally againſt the common enemies of our faith: and as he had ended this ſpeech, he perceived <hi>Liſvart,</hi> and the Knight of the Sphere very neer him: then addreſſing himſelfe firſt to <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vart,</hi> he ſaid to him, truly Knight, I very much rejoice to ſee you in ſo good health, conſidering the wicked ſpeech of that moſt unhappy <hi>Melia,</hi> which ſhe ſent us ſince your departure: but as for you (ſaid he, merrily ſpeaking to the Knight of the Sphere) I ſhall never in all my life for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the wrong that you did me, the day that you went from my Court, without daigning to ſpeak to me, nor any other, as I know, and is the principall reaſon why I am come to finde you, to avenge my ſelſe for it. Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Perion,</hi> I humbly intreat you to pardon me, for I am ready to ſuffer for it, what puniſhment you pleaſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is no fault in me, as you may know, having truly underſtood of all that is paſt, during the conference between them, the young <hi>Floreſtan, Galuanes,</hi> and <hi>Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nir</hi> diſcourſed with <hi>Amadis,</hi> and the other Knight of their acquaintance, relating to each other their paſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. It began to grow late, wherefore the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> invited the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond</hi> to lodge in his Palace: but he bravely excuſed himſelfe, becauſe he had no intention to enter into the City, (as he ſaid) before the enemies were expulſed out of <hi>Thrace:</hi> and for this cauſe commanded his tents and Pavilions to be made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Nevertheleſs <hi>Amadis</hi> ſo much intreated him, that he lodged in that which <hi>Alquif</hi> gave to <hi>Liſvart,</hi> which was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52725:61"/>ſuch, as you have heard. And after a long conference between the two Emperours, giving the good night each to other, the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> returned to keep his City, and the other to his Camp, where <hi>Amadis,</hi> and thoſe of the Firme Iſland kept him company: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they tooke a walke into <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he went to ſalute the old Empereſſe, which they yet found troubled with a ſwouning, which had taken her, for the great joy ſhe had to ſee her daughter in good health, which ſhe certainly thought to be dead. And as the Emperour entred in, where they lay on her bed, he began to ſpeak to her. Madam, you now have the company of your daughter and other Ladies: but ſee, if I am ill provided of Knights. Then <hi>Amadis, Liſvart,</hi> and the others went forwards to do him reverence. If then this Lady rejoyced, it is you may thinke, eſpecially, when ſhe ſaw her ſon in Law, who ſhe held in her armes above a quarter of an houre, without being able to ſpeak one word: But for this night they had no time to diſcourſe much longer with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the time preſſed the Knights of the Firme Iſland to returne towards the Emperour of <hi>Trebiſond:</hi> wherefore taking leave of her and the Emperour, they went forth of the City, and entred the Camp. Now the Knight of the Sphere had not yet had an opportunity prvately to diſcourſe with <hi>Alquefa,</hi> to know in what eſtate ſhe left the Princeſſe <hi>Gricilerea,</hi> for whoſe ſake he died an hundred times a day: but as ſoone as <hi>Amadis</hi> and the others were departed, he and <hi>Liſvart</hi> retired to their quarters, where ſhe came to finde them. Nevertheleſſe, at firſt ſhe very well forbore to ſpeak that which ſhe had in charge, for ſhe did not know whither <hi>Perion</hi> was content that ſhe ſhould diſcourſe thereof before his companion, which <hi>Perion</hi> perceiving, both aſſured and perſwaded her, that it would be pleaſant to him, conſidering the great love which he bore him. Wherefore ſhe drew forth a Letter which ſhe had in her boſome, and preſented it to him, ſaying to him, my Lady recommendeth her ſelfe very

And knowing of the great aid that was come to the Emperour of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> they met together in Counſell to conſult what they ſhould doe: where it was concluded that their Camp ſhould be fortified, and trenches made, and ſo they ſhould remaine to ſee what their enemies would doe, and in the meane time they would burie their dead, and heale the wounded, which indeed were many. And to the end (ſaid <hi>Armato</hi>) that our enemies may not affright us; I am of opinion that all this night the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Drums may ſound with great joy. During this Counſell the Chriſtians on the other ſide did ſo well, that all their forces were landed before break of day, and were in good order to receive their enemies, if they ſhould
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52725:63"/>come to aſſaile them. Then there came to the Tent of <hi>Amadis,</hi> the Emperour of Rome, the Kings of <hi>Sobradiſe,</hi> of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of <hi>Scotland, Bohemia, Spaine, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Sanſuegue, Mongaze,</hi> of <hi>Sueſie,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Calafea,</hi> and <hi>Norandell,</hi> all which had brought with them good ſtore of Souldiers, as well horſe as foot, and paſſing the <hi>Hellefpont, Norandell,</hi> and <hi>Frandalo</hi> had joined with them, with the Army of the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which ſtaid to conduct them. The reaſon why they came to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> was to conſult about what they had to doe: but they concluded on nothing at that time, but onely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond</hi> to be their Commander in Chiefe, and Captaine General in this their enterprize. And therefore they went to him, to intreat him to take that charge upon him. But he would not, but thanked them and excuſed himſelfe, and ſaid that the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was fitter by reaſon that he had already knowne the force of the enemie. Wherefore it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſend to the Emperor to know his pleaſure, who no ſooner heard thereof, but he mounted on horſeback, and went to them, where when he came, they told him what had been done amongſt them, and to that end they all intreated him to accept of the charge, and they would obey him in all his commands. But he knew ſo well how to excuſe himſelfe that in the end, and by the advice of all the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond</hi> remained Captaine of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the field, and the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was Captaine Generall of the Forces in the Towne, as he was before. It was now dinner time, wherefore the Tables were covered in <hi>Amadis</hi> his Tent; but the firſt courſe was hardly eaten, when a Damſell armed at all points came before them, carrying in her hand a bowe of Ivorie, and a ſheaf of Arrowes hanging at her ſide. Then without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting any of them, ſhe demanded which was the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> King of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and of great <hi>Britaine.</hi> So they were both ſhewn to her, wherefore ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe to them, and with a great boldneſs ſaid
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52725:63"/>to them: Here, take this writing, and give me anſwer that ſhall become you. Then ſhe gave to each of them a Letter, and another to Queen <hi>Calafea,</hi> ſaying to her: Madam, your habit declares what you are, read this paper which is ſent to you and conſider of it. So theſe three Letters were read, and that to the Emperour contained that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>

But if theſe two made the beholders to be abaſhed it was nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to what they ſaw <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Grifflant</hi> doe: for even as two Smiths take pleaſure to beat the hot Iron on the Anvill, even ſo theſe two warriours continued ſmite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one another without any breathing. But in the end <hi>Grifflant</hi> found himſelfe ſomewhat aſtoniſhed, becauſe he had never dealt with a man that had ſo put him to his ſhifts. <hi>Pintiquineſtra</hi> and <hi>Calafea</hi> were not in the mean time idle, but all the Spectators were ſo taken up with behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Grifflant,</hi> that they minded no others, eſpecially the Knight of the Sphere, and <hi>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52725:68"/>And to tell the truth, they maintained themſelves ſo well, that by the ſpace of one houre or more, it was not poſſible to tell to whom fortune was moſt favourable. For <hi>Grifflant</hi> was a puiſſant man, and of a great heart. Nevertheleſſe in the end he began to faint through loſs of his blood, and every one aſſured themſelves that <hi>Amadis</hi> would have the victory. Therefore <hi>Amadis</hi> deſired him to have pitie on himſelfe, and he would ſave his life and honor, if he would be ruled by him. And how ſhall that be ſaid <hi>Grifflant?</hi> as for my life, I value it not, for death is common to all, but if it now ſtand with my honor and renown, I will obey you. I pray you then ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> leave this ungodly and wicked Law, and take ours which is the true and perfect, and never doe damage to the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but help him with all your power. By <hi>Mercurie</hi> anſwered <hi>Grifflant,</hi> you preach very well! doe you think to vanquiſh me ſooner with your words then with your weapons? therefore guard your ſelfe from me, for I hope before I die to carbonadoe you handſomely if I can. Then he took his ſword in both his hands and thought to have given <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> a blow on the head, but he defended himſelfe with his ſhield, and gave <hi>Grifflant</hi> ſuch a blow on the leg, that he was forced to fall on his knees to ſuſteine himſelfe, which <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing, he tooke him by the Helmet, and thruſt his ſword into his body, and ſo he fell down dead: then giving him a blow with his foot on his bellie, he marched towards <hi>Armato,</hi> to whom he cryed: King, thou ſhalt preſently dye by my hands, for you have reigned too long to hurt this Country. <hi>Armato</hi> being afraid to hear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus threatned, by him who he moſt feared of any man in the world, began to complaine to him againſt whom he had enterprized the Combate, ſaying to him, I know not Emperour if you will ſuffer a ſecond with you, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage me, conſidering the agreement we have had toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you doe ſo you will procure your ſelfe the name of a Traitor. That ſhall not be if it pleaſe God, ſaid the Emperour. And addreſſing himſelfe to <hi>Amadis,</hi> he deſired

                  </gap>ill the Combate of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and <hi>Griſflant</hi> was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which when it was finiſhed, and <hi>Pintiquineſtra</hi> ſeeing the Emperor to refuſe the aide of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and <hi>Armato</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſtand greatly in feare of him, ſhe was afraid leaſt he ſhould come to her. Wherefore ſhe prevented him, and marching towards him, ſhe ſaid to him with a good grace, Sir Knight, it is well knowne of all the endeavour that the Queene <hi>Calafea</hi> and I have uſed to vanquiſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: nevertheleſſe we have been ſo equall in our fight, that no man can give certaine judgment to whom the honor muſt remaine. And I have now ſeen that with my owne eyes which I did heare by your renowne, and I have known ſo much Knighthood in you, that to have your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and acquaintance I am determined not onely to leave the Combate, but alſo to be baptized, and beleeve in the God of your Law: upon Condition, that during the war begun by the Pagans, againſt the Emperor of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> you be content that I accompanie you, and aſſoone as it be ended, you give to me in mariage ſome Knight of your Linnage worthy of me, who am Queen and Ladie of ſo many Countries, that I command all my neighbours: When <hi>Amadis</hi> underſtood the will of <hi>Pintiquineſtra,</hi> he was more glad then if he had conquered the beſt City of <hi>Aſia:</hi> wherefore he anſwered. Truly Madam, I am very joyfull of your good will, that I may this day name my ſelfe the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Knight of Chriſtendome, God having given me the meanes to bring out of the way of damnation ſo noble a Queen as you are. And as for the Covenants which you demand, either to acccompanie, or to provide you a husband: you may aſſure your ſelfe that I will obey you, not onely in a matter ſo reaſonable, but alſo in what elſe you will require of me, even to name my ſelfe your Knight all my life whereſoever I ſhall be. By my Faith ſaid the Queene, it is good reaſon that you are eſteemed, and the moſt Courteous
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52725:69"/>King in the world. Saying ſo ſhe ſet her knees to the ground to kiſſe his hands: but <hi>Amadis</hi> lovingly took her up, and graciouſly imbraced her. When Queene <hi>Calafea</hi> ſaw them upon theſe points, ſhe ſuddenly pulled off her Helmet, and throwing it on the ground, ſhe took her ſword by the point, and preſenting the pummell thereof to the Queen <hi>Pintiquineſtra,</hi> ſhe ſaid to her: Madam, ſeeing that you have vanquiſhed your ſelfe, and that without doubt I could not have reſiſted you; it is good reaſon that I render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the honour which you deſerve. Ah! Madam, anſwered <hi>Pintiquineſtra,</hi> you doe that which I ought! and ſo ſtrving to give their ſword, to one another, <hi>Amadis</hi> went between them, and cauſed them to exchange ſwords, that their honors might be equall. During theſe paſſages, the two old men, <hi>Armato</hi> and the Emperor of <hi>Trehiſond</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured very much to performe their Combate. But <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> had ſomewhat fainted ſince <hi>Griſflant</hi> had been van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. Wherefore the Emperour charged him nimbly, and in ſuch manner, that he gave him ſo great a blow with his ſword, that it entred through armor, and went a handfull into his fleſh juſt at the joint of his left ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo that in ſmall time his ſoule departed, and he fell downe dead in the place. Which gave ſuch great joy to the Chriſtian Army, that every one praiſed God, eſpecially <hi>Oriana</hi> and the other Ladies. The Trumpets and Fifes did ſound with great joy, and horſes were brought to the Conquerors, who took their way to their Tents, where they were accompanied by many Kings and great Lords, who honored <hi>Pintiquineſtra</hi> as much as they could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>

The principall of the Army did much wonder what cauſed the two Queens to parlie, being in the midſt of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: wherefore they prayed <hi>Pintiquineſtra</hi> to tell them. So ſhe told them particularly what had happened, and their diſcourſe was ſo long, that it was high time to goe to dinner. And ſo they ſpent the reſt of the day in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about their enemies. She was as eloquent a woman in her ſpeech as any in the world, and had ſo good a grace accompanied with a beautie ſo excellent, that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> ſon of <hi>Galaor</hi> fell in love with her, and in time enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, as you ſhall heare in this our Hiſtory. Not long after there arived at the Tent a Dwarfe, who was ſoone known by the Emperour of <hi>Trebiſond;</hi> for it was the ſame that brought the writing from <hi>Melia,</hi> when <hi>Liſvart</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> as you have formerly heard. Then the Dwarfe went to the Queene <hi>Pintiquineſtra,</hi> and with great audacity ſaid to her, Queene <hi>Pintiquineſtra, Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rix</hi> of <hi>Liquea</hi> (who is newly choſen Commander in chief by the deceaſe of my Sovereigne Lord) hath ſent thee thy fix thouſand women, becauſe he is reſolved not to have any aid of thoſe whoſe Leader and Chiefe is a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Traitor. And he had put them all to the Sword, but that he conſidered the paines they tooke to gaine the City
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52725:70"/>the ſecond day of thy arivall: but if for the future any of them ſhall happen into his hands, he will make them examples of Juſtice. And as for thy ſelfe he is ready to prove his perſon againſt thine that thou art a Traitor, therefore give me anſwer to juſtifie your ſelfe. Dwarfe my friend, anſwered the Queen, I am glad of the returne of my women, and if he hath a deſire to make me know that which I never yet did know, nor never will, (if pleaſe God) which is treaſon, let him come to the place from whence he came this morning, and there he ſhall finde me ready to make him confeſſe that he hath hid in his throat. This anſwer of the Queens was commended by all the Knights preſent, eſpecially by <hi>Liſvart</hi> who ſaid to the Dwarfe. My friend when thou haſt related to <hi>Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi> the anſwer of this faire and wiſe Queen, I pray tell him that a Knight in her Company ſends to him that he did not well, to ſend ſuch injurious words to the Queene, being in company with ſo many valiant Knights, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to them, not that I have a ſmall eſteeme of her, but for the honor of Chivalry. And if he thinks good, tell him I will take armes for her, and will performe what ever ſhe hath promiſed by thee. The Dwarfe hearing him ſpeak with ſo good a confidence, looked earneſtly on him, that he might know him againe. Then taking his leave of the Company, he returned to <hi>Alminix,</hi> where he ſtaid but little before he carried an anſwer to the Queen, how his Maſter accepted of the Combate, but not ſaid he this day, for it is now late, but to morrow by break of day, upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you give him aſſurance of Chriſtians, as he will of his Campe. And as for you (Knight of the true Croſſe) ſaid he to <hi>Liſvart,</hi> he ſends word to you, that to ſatisfie the deſire which you have to fight, he will bring with him a King of no leſſe eſteeme then was <hi>Armato.</hi> And you ſhall finde him ſo good a Champion, that he will put you to it, for he is much greater in bodie then you are. Now he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Liſvart</hi> by this name of the true Croſſe, becauſe he had a red Croſſe in his Sheild, but <hi>Amadis</hi> knowing that he had
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52725:70"/>another like that between his two teats, he found this name ſo conformeable to his nature, that he prayed him not to change it from thence forwards, in ſuch manner, that for a long time after he was alwayes called ſo. <hi>Liſvart</hi> then hearing the Dwarfe ſummon him to the Combate, ſpake thus to him: Dwarfe, thy Maſter doth very much for me, in giving me occaſion to accompany the Queen in ſo good a buſineſs. You may tell him that I accept of the Combate with him that he promiſeth me, and if he be great as you ſay, men are not meaſured by the ell, but by the good heart and courage. So the Dwarfe ſtayed not any longer, but tooke his leave of the Chriſtian Lords, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>Alminix,</hi> and the other Kings who had ſent him, whom he found embalming the dead bodies of <hi>Armato</hi> and <hi>Grifflant</hi> to ſend them into their Countries, waiting a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunitie to performe their furnerals: but ſo ſoone as they heard the report of the Dwarfe, they were extreame joyfull, eſpecially the King of the Giant Iſland, father to <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> who was he againſt whom the Knight of the true Croſſe had to doe, and he had enterprized the Combate in hopes to vanquiſh him, and make him publikely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the manner of his deliverance: for which cauſe <hi>Gradafilea</hi> was very ſad, for ſhe loved <hi>Liſvart</hi> more then her owne ſelfe, and knowing the Proweſſe of her Father, ſhe thought it impoſſiible that he would withſtand him: ſo that ſhe did continually thinke how ſhe might breake this enterprize. Once ſhe remembred her ſelfe that <hi>Liſvart</hi> owed her one gift, and that it was beſt to pray him to defer the Combate. Then againe ſhe conſidered, that for ſo ſmall a requeſt he would remaine quit to her, and ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine out of hopes to have his love. Thus ſhe could not tell what to doe, but ſhe thought at the furtheſt, if her father ſhould vanquiſh him then ſhe would beg his life, and ſo he would be more obliged to her then before, and in this reſolution ſhe ſlept, untill the next morning, when things happened, as you ſhall heare.</p>

Madam, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I have one which I have conquered, and tried in many good places, therefore I pray let it ſerve your neceſſity; and I would not preſent it to you, but that I eſteeme you as my ſecond ſelf. Sir ſaid ſhe, I would not take it, but that I will deliver it to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſafe and ſound with many thanks. So <hi>Amadis</hi> girded it on her, and ſoon after ſhe and the Knight of the true Croſs went out of the Tent, and their horſes at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

The Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did the like for <hi>Liſvart;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they found within the Liſt, <hi>Almiries</hi> of <hi>Liquea,</hi> and the King of the Giant Iſland waiting for them, they made no long Ceremonies before they began the Combate. Theſe Pagan Princes were armed with black Armes for grief of <hi>Armato;</hi> and the King of the Giant Iſland had a large ſhield, whereon was portracted two wounded Giants dead, and he did ſeem by his countenance to be a very valiant man. The Trumpets ſoon began to found, and the Knight of the true Croſs, and the King of the Giant Iſland came againſt one another, and the King of the Giant Iſland was caſt from his horſe, and the Knight of the true Croſs had had the like fortune, if he had not gotten hold of his horſes maine. On the other ſide, the Queene <hi>Pintiquineſtra,</hi> and <hi>Almirix,</hi> were not the meane time idle, although their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune differed from the others, for they broke their Lances, and neither of them was moved out of their ſaddle, to the wonder of the beholders. In the mean time <hi>Liſvart</hi> turned his bridle, and ſeeing his enemy on his feet, he left his horſe alſo; then there began a moſt cruell conflict, and they charged one another ſo fiercely, that they were often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to kneel on the ground. Thus they ſpared one another ſo little, that the field was in many places dyed with their blood, and with the pieces of the Harneſſes; when the King retiring on one ſide, ſpake thus to his enemy; I think ſir Knight, that the day is long enough for us to end our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, I pray you therefore let us take breath a little. <hi>Liſvart</hi> had not forgotten what was ſaid to him of <hi>Onolorea,</hi> and therefore he would not make any anſwer, but redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his blows, he gave the ſpectators to underſtand that his ſtrength was redoubled. Yet his enemy was not a jot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, but like a wiſe and hardy Champion, he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelfe, and aſſailed his enemy. The Queene <hi>Pinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quineſtra</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:52725:72"/>uſed her utmoſt to gain the Victory, her ſword was ſo good, that ſhe gave never a blow to <hi>Almirix</hi> that did not cut to the quick. Wherefore he was ſo angred, that he ſtruck her ſuch a blow, that ſhe was forced to ſtep back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but ſhe ſoon revenged her ſelf, for ſhe ſtruck him ſo right between the Helmet and the ſhoulders, that his ſoul preſently departed, and left his body dead in the place. When ſhe had done thus, ſhe retired under the ſhadow of a tree, to ſee what would happen to the King of the Giant Iſland, and the Knight of the true Croſs, who were then ſtriving to throw one another down. <hi>Gradafilea</hi> was very joyfull to ſee the great proweſs of the Knight of the true Croſs, whom ſhe loved with all her ſoul. One thing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her, which was to think that the death of the one or the other would be grievous to her, the one being her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the other her Lover. The blood which the King of the Giant Iſland did continually loſe from his wounds, did make him very feeble, as it was well known by all the ſpectators. Not long after, the King of the Giant Iſland thinking to ward a blow, retreated ſomewhat back-wards, and in the going, he fell down in ſuch manner, that every one ſuppoſed him to be dead: wherefore the Knight of the true Croſs went forwards, and in all diligence ſet his foot on his neck, and endeavoured to break the buckles of his Armour, whereby he might cut off his head. But he heard a voice crying continually, Ah, ah, <hi>Liſvart, Liſvart!</hi> at this cry he looked about and ſaw the fair <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> who being come to him, caſt her ſelf at his feet, and with tears in her eyes, ſaid thus; Alas Knight, if you are now ſo pittifull of me, as I was of you when I delivered you out of Priſon, ſave the life of him that begat me, and this is the boon which I deſire of you as you promiſed me, otherwiſe let us both die by your hands. The Knight of the true Croſs knew her very well, wherefore leaving the King who was under him, he went to take up <hi>Gradafilea</hi> who was on her knees, and in taking her under the Arme, he ſaid: By my faith Damſell, the Obligation wherein I am indebted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52725:72"/>to you is ſo great, and the power which you have over me is ſo much, that the leaſt meſſenger you could have ſent had beed more then ſufficient. One thing I entreat of you, that is, that you and he go along with me, and I aſſure you that you ſhall have as good entertainment as I can poſſible. There was then come to them the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Trebiſond, Amadis, Pintiquineſtra,</hi> and many other great Perſonages, to hear the diſcourſe between the Knight of the true Croſs and the Damſell, to whom he ſaid, that through her means alone he was then alive. For ſaid he, it was ſhe and none other that delivered me out of the hands of curſed <hi>Melia.</hi> For which cauſe there was none in the Company that did not reſpect her and her Father, whoſe Horſe was brought; then they all mounting, did ride to the Tent of <hi>Amadis</hi> where they alighted. But they had hardly put their feet to the ground when <hi>Alquefa</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who addreſſing her ſelfe to the Emperour of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> entreated him kindly on the behalfe of <hi>Oriana,</hi> to bring <hi>Liſvart</hi> and the King of the Giant Iſland to the City, for ſhe would have Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to look to their wounds, and ſhe likewiſe deſired to ſee <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> and Queene <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquineſtra</hi> which all the Lords preſent, conſented to.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Pagans Army was much troubled, ſeeing <hi>Atmirix</hi> of <hi>Liquie</hi> dead, and the King of the Giant Iſland out of their power, wherefore knowing that there was no remedy, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Counſell. Where it was concluded to ſend to the Chriſtians to aske truce for fifteen dayes, wherein they might make the deceaſed Kings Funerall, and ſend their bodies into <hi>Aſia</hi> to be buried. Wherefore they diſpatched Embaſſadors for that purpoſe, who came to <hi>Amadis,</hi> who having known the reaſon of their embaſſage, enformed the other Princes thereof, who would not ſay any thing untill he had declared his judgement: wherefore being forced thereunto, he ſaid thus; It is very certain ſir, that this wicked people are come into this Country, more to offend true Religion, and the faith of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> then the Country of <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Conſiantinople;</hi> wherefore I think that we ſhould not hearken to them in any ſuch requeſt, and that rather we go to find them out and fight them, and drive them to the furtheſt parts of <hi>Tartaria:</hi> And if it be objected that they are great in number, I ſay that they are moſt of them weak in body, and much diſheartned; and which is more, we fight for the faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in whoſe power are all Victories; and therefore we ſhall be ſure to vanquiſh them. This opinion was approved of by all: Wherefore the Emperour of <hi>Trebiſond</hi> gave this anſwer; Sirs Ambaſſadors, we will have no truce with you; but if you do not depart before to morrow, we will drive you out; and thus you muſt enform thoſe who ſent you. This news pleaſed them not, and it did leſſe pleaſe the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52725:73"/>Princes of the Army, for they had in the former aſſaults loſt the chief of their Souldiers, and the reſt were much diſcouraged. Wherefore the Captaines of the Army reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try their fortunes once againe, before they ſhould be more diminiſhed, and therefore they gave order to the Souldiers to be ready by Sun riſing to go fight their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But they were not ſo ſecret, but the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> heard thereof by his Spics, and therefore told the other Princes thereof that they might be ready. In the mean time thoſe that had been wounded were recovered, and their forces were ordered in this manner. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had the guard of the Town, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Quedragant,</hi> King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Norwales, Angrot,</hi> and <hi>Eſtrevaux, Bruner</hi> ſon to the Giant <hi>Balan,</hi> and <hi>Gaſquiles</hi> King of <hi>Sueſſe,</hi> with a number of footmen.

Wherefore they diligenty provided for all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So they likewiſe ſent to their Sea Army, and gave order to them, that ſo ſoone as they ſhould ſee a Signall of fire, they ſhould affaile the Chriſtians ſleet, but if the worſt ſhould happen on their part, they ſhould remaine on the Coaſt of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whereby they might ſave their men. But they did not give the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet untill the day break. But if they had they would have found the Chriſtians ready. In the meane time <hi>Yrguion</hi> ſon to <hi>Gandelin,</hi> (whom <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule</hi> had brought from great Britaine to ſerve him as an Eſquire) preſented him before <hi>Amadis:</hi> and being armed at all points, ſaid to him. Sir, I am ſon to <hi>Gandalin</hi> your ancient ſervant. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreat you to give me honour of Chivalrie: ſeeing that it is impoſſible (as I think) that at a better time I can enter into armes being the day of the Conflict. <hi>Amadis</hi> had never before ſeen him, nevertheleſſe, when he knew who he was, he welcommed him for his fathers ſake. And ſent for his father, and in his preſence gave him the order in ſo reaſonable a time, that he had hardly remounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back when the Enemies marched a great pace towards
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52725:74"/>them. And at their firſt meeting their Lances breaking in peeces on their armour made ſuch a noiſe, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall flames of fire as was a pitifull thing to behold, and more eſpecially to heare the complaints of thoſe that were wounded, ſome on their heads, and on their armes, ſome on their bodies, as it was their ill fortunes. <hi>Amadis, Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, Perion,</hi> and <hi>Liſvart</hi> threw foure Kings dead to the ground at the firſt onſet, and entring into the battaile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed by many good Knights, performed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. And there was killed at the firſt onſet on both ſides more then thirtie thouſand perſons. There the Knights of the Sphere, and of the true Croſſe triumphed: for before they laid hands on their Swords, they diſarmed fifteen Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, of the braveſt of the Army. The two Queenes <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lafea</hi> and <hi>Pintiquineſtra</hi> did as well behave themſelves, ſlaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and throwing to ground all thoſe that they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe five Devils gave never a blow but death followed: at which <hi>Amadis</hi> being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, he went with <hi>Galaor, Floreſtan, Argamont,</hi> and <hi>Arda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile Canile:</hi> who having all recovered new Lances, ran up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Giants, and broke their Lances in them, without moving them in their ſaddles. The ſlaughter was great on both ſides: for <hi>Amadis</hi> being followed by ten or twelve thouſand french horſe men, was charged by the Souldans of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Alape</hi> who had more then thirtie thouſand Turks and Tartarians. And as <hi>Amadis</hi> followed on in all diligence, an old man having a white beard down to his girdle, ſtaid him, and ſaid roughly to him, King <hi>Amadis</hi> leave this Chaſe, and goe aid thy Children, if thou wilt not looſe them, ſeeing they are well nigh defeated. He had hardly pronounced theſe words, when he vaniſhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Amadis</hi> being a baſhed, caſt his eyes on all ſides, and ſaw <hi>Gandalin</hi> who carried his Enſigne ſo torne, that the greateſt part was hardly ſufficient to cover his head:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52725:75"/>and after him was <hi>Yrguian</hi> his ſon, doing ſuch deeds of Armes, that he this day got as much houour as any new Knight within ten yeares time had done. So <hi>Amadis</hi> drew neer to them to know newes of what he ſought: but <hi>Yrguian</hi> taking him, and ſhewing him the Knight of the Sphere, and <hi>Liſvart</hi> ſaid to him, Sir, let us goe and aid them which you ſee in ſuch dangers. Follow me then anſwered he; And ſpurring of his horſe, making his paſſage with his Sword, he met <hi>Galaor,</hi> the King <hi>Cildadan, Quedragant</hi> ſon of <hi>Quedragant, Talanque, Garinter,</hi> and many other Knights, to whom he ſaid in paſſing by, Lords, for Gods ſake let us aid <hi>Perion,</hi> and <hi>Liſvart</hi> who are beſet. Saying ſo, he went forwards, and for all the Pagans reſiſtance, he joyned with them: nevertheleſſe before they arived there, <hi>Liſvart</hi> and <hi>Perions</hi> horſes were ſlaine under them, and the Queens <hi>Calafea</hi> and <hi>Pintiquineſtra</hi> were thrown downe and brought to great extremity. Nevertheleſs they had found the meanes to help themſelves, and they foure fought on foot ſo valiantly, that neither Turke nor Arabian dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach neere them, without the help of ten Giants, who came to encloſe them: with whom they had ſo much to doe, that at the time that <hi>Amadis</hi> arived they were well nigh ſpent, who ſceing his Children in ſuch danger, he was ſo inraged, that laying aſide all feare of death, he entred Pell-Mell amongſt their Giants, ſo that foure of them were ſlaine at that houre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And theſe two Armies did fight ſo valiantly, that had it not been ſor the night which ſeparated them, there had not one eſcaped. In the meane time the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:52725:75"/>with his troope, uſed all diligence to take the City: and after he had prepared all things in diligence, he went with fiftie thonſand choſen Souldiers to fire the Gates: but bravely repulſed, by a Sally which was made by <hi>Gaſquilon</hi> King of <hi>Sueſſe, Bruneo,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Balan, Angriole</hi> L'<hi>Eſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux, Sarquiles,</hi> and a great number of Knights, and others who behaved themſelves ſo well, that the King was taken Priſoner, more then ſix thouſand Paleſtines defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ten Elephants overthrowne, and ſeven or eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ladders broken in peeces. Nevertheleſs a good part of the wall was at laſt thrown down by force of their Rams, and other Engines. When the Pagans ran directly to the Bulwarke, and there they fought hand to hand, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe within well nigh out of breath, if the Emperor had not then arvived, but at his arivall he did performe ſuch deeds of Armes, that he ſtopped his enemies, and made them ſomewhat retire. You have now heard what was done on the Land, now it remaineth to tell you what was done at Sea. <hi>Norandell</hi> and the Earle <hi>Frandalo,</hi> coming neere to the Kings of <hi>Bugie,</hi> of <hi>Giloffe</hi> gave ſigne of Battell to their ſouldiers: and they had ſo faire a winde, that at their arivall they did much hurt to the Turks by their Lances of fire, and Granadoes, wherewith fiftie Veſſells were ſpoiled preſently. And the Dukes of <hi>Ortilenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and <hi>Alaſtre</hi> did make it evidently appeare, with what affection they ſerved their Maſter. And the Apes that were in the great Ship that brought <hi>Amadis</hi> and thoſe of the Firme Iſland.

But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this fierce battell was thus, that in leſſe then an houres ſpace there was more then five hundred Veſſells of the Enemies ſuncke, but this was not done without the loſſe of many good Chriſtians.

But there was a great ſlaughter, in ſuch manner, that the blood co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the fields, juſt like the overflowing of a River in the time of a flood, and had it not been for the obſcure night, there had not been one of the Enemies ſaved. Then <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> commanded to ſound the retreat, hoping the next day to purſue their good fortune. Thoſe who gave the aſſault to the Towne had won it, had it not been that one reported to them, that the battell was loſt, wherefore (being ſeized with cold feare) they retired in bad order. Which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror knowing, he chaſed them, ſo that he did ſlay ten thouſand of them, then being conſtrained to leave the Chaſe by reaſon of the dark, they entred into the City, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to purſue their enterprize ſo ſoon as day ſhould appear. But it was not the determination of thoſe that fled, for they reſolved to take ſhipping ſo ſoon as they could, and depart. And this determination they ſoon put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. And by good chance they found their ſhips, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they entred, not ſtanding upon Complements who ſhould firſt enter, ſo that ſix thouſand of them were drown'd for haſte, and ſix thouſand more remained on the Land, having no ſhipping. So the Moone ſhining bright and cleer, they had the better meanes to weigh anchors, and depart.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52725:76"/>Which <hi>Frandalo</hi> underſtanding, he preſently purſued, but the winde was faire for thoſe that fled, and contrrary to thoſe that purſued. Nevertheleſſe they were overtooke by the ſwifteſt Veſſells, and forced to fight with as much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor as they could to ſave their lives. Thus you may ſee what happened to this great Army of Pagans. Whereby was fulfilled the writing which the Knight of the Sphere found written in the Roule of gilt Copper, at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, where A <hi>lquefa</hi> cauſed him to ſtay, as you have heard in the fift chapter.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52725:77"/>ſide there was a Caſtle, where they ſaw two Knights armed with black armour, who tooke two Lances, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the foot of the bridge, they ſent a Damſell before them, to defend the paſſage to paſſengers. This woman made no delay in performing what ſhe was commanded, for ſhe met the Knights, and inquired who was the chief amongſt them. Damſell anſwered the King <hi>Don Galaor,</hi> we are all alike, and Companions. Well then ſaid ſhe, heare the meſſage that I have brought to you. They defend ſaid ſhe (pointing to the Knights of the Fortreſſe) the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage over this bridge, which they have enterprized to keep a whole yeare, by the Commandement of thoſe whom they love, without ſuffering any Knight to paſſe by, if it be not on theſe conditions. None that is alone ſhall paſs by without juſting with one of them. And if they be two, they ſhall each deal with one of them. And if they be two, they ſhall each deal with one, who if they be caſt from their horſes, and ours remaine on horſeback, in this caſe they ſhall loſe their ſheilds and horſes: but if the ill fortune fails on their part, they ſhall have the like loſſe, and may no more enterprize to guard this bridge. But if it happen that both the aſſaylants, and the Defendants are thrown down at the firſt encounter, they may all foure come to the Combate of the Sword, under the ſame condition of the Lance. And if none are unhorſed, then they are to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile one another untill they be and not to fight with the Sword. Thus I have told you the Covenants, which you are to peforme if you will paſte any further: which they pray you not to take ill at their hands. Truly ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> the Knights have reaſon to obey the Commands of their Ladies: nevertheleſs, it diſpleaſeth me that they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken ſuch an enterprize. Wherefore goe tell them that we will paſſe over the bridge, according to the agreement which they have ſent us: So the Damſell departed to the two Knights. They had come two by two: wherefore they agreed together, that they would in the like manner goe to the Juſt, in ſuch manner, that <hi>Belleris</hi> Nephew to the Admirall <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Siontes</hi> were the firſt, who came
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52725:78"/>againſt the Knights, and their encounters were ſuch, that <hi>Belleris</hi> and <hi>Siontes</hi> broke their ſtaves, but the Knights of the bridge diſarmed them, and threw them on the ground. Then there came foure Squires, who ſeized on their horſes and Sheilds. So they ſtood ſtill to ſee what would happen to <hi>Brunette,</hi> and <hi>Teluis</hi> the flemming, who were as illy handled as the others. Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Yrguian</hi> his ſon ſet forwards, but their horſes was likewiſe ſeized on by the Squires: wherefore <hi>Dragonis</hi> and <hi>Balonir</hi> hoped to revenge them, and therefore they met the Knights of the bridge ſo rightly, that their Lances flew into ſhivers, but they were unhorſed aſwell as the reſt, loſing their ſheilds and horſes. Then <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Sobradiſe</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced againſt the black Knights, who broke their Lances but were thrown to the ground, and their horſes ſeized on by the Squires: Then <hi>Florestan</hi> and <hi>Parmenir</hi> his brother went forwards, who met thoſe of the bridge ſo bravely, that they all foure broke their Lances: and therefore no Lances were brought them, when they recharged one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in ſuch manner, that <hi>Floreſtan</hi> and <hi>Parmenir</hi> were diſmounted, and the Spectators did think their necks had been broken. By my faith ſaid Queen <hi>Mabila,</hi> I think I ſhall be a Propheteſs, and that they will diſmount you all: Then <hi>Vaillides</hi> and <hi>Languines</hi> came to the Juſt, who at the firſt encounter were diſmounted: at which the Knights of Sphere, and the True Croſſe were vexed. But there came preſently <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> who broke their Lances, and met with their bodies in ſuch manner, that Abies and <hi>Quedragant</hi> fell on the ground. Then <hi>Argamont</hi> and <hi>Ardadile Canile</hi> ſet forwards, whom the two black Knights met with two of the ſtrongeſt Lances, and moved the Giants in ſuch manner, that they loſt their ſtirrops and broke their Lances in more then twentie peeces, in ſuch manner, that againſt their wills they had the like for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes as their fellowes, and the Squires tooke their horſes and ſheilds, which they carried where the others were, The black Knights in the meane time took new Lances,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52725:78"/>attending for <hi>Draror</hi> ſon to the Giant <hi>Balan,</hi> and <hi>Gatuate du <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>al Cranitif</hi> againſt whom they broke, nevertheleſs their meeting was ſuch, that <hi>Braror</hi> and <hi>Gatuate</hi> had no better fortune then their fellowes. Wherefore the King <hi>Norandell,</hi> and valiant <hi>Frandalo</hi> preſented themſelves, and their fortune was ſo good that they all foure broke their Lances, which the Squires ſeeing, they ran haſtily and brought them new Lances, wherewith they met with ſuch puiſſance, that <hi>Norandell</hi> and <hi>Frandalo</hi> did againe break their Lances. But they that guarded the bridge did much better: for their Lances remaining whole they threw down the others moſt rudely on the graſſe. Then the Prince of <hi>Brand die,</hi> and Marquis <hi>Saluder</hi> advanced, who at the firſt encounter were diſmounted, the others Lances remaining whole. So ſoone after <hi>Angriole L'Eſtrevaux,</hi> and <hi>Sarquiles</hi> advanced in ſuch manner, that they remained on horſeback for three Careers: Nevertheleſs in concluſion, they left their horſes and armes as a gage: and <hi>Manly</hi> with <hi>Amber</hi> of <hi>Gandell</hi> came to the Jouſt; theſe two made no great reſiſtance, no more then the Earle of <hi>Alaſtre,</hi> and <hi>Alarin,</hi> whoſe horſes and ſheilds were carried to the others. Wherefore <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> came with ſuch fierceneſs to the black Knights that their foure Lances flew into the aire, and nevertheleſs <hi>Galuanes</hi> and <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> were throwne to the ground: but ſoon after came <hi>Dardanie</hi> King of <hi>Breigne,</hi> and <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Norwales,</hi> who were no better handled then the reſt.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52725:79"/>Squires. Then <hi>Galaor,</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> the good Juſter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and they did ſo well that ſeven Lances were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before any of them could be unhorſed, but at the ſeventh courſe they all met with ſuch force, that the two black Knights had been forced to fall had not they held by their horſes necks, but <hi>Galaor</hi> and his Companion were thrown down. Wherefore <hi>Mabila</hi> being abaſhed, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Liſvart</hi> ſhould not juſt, for ſaid ſhe, you two on horſeback may ſoone goe and fetch Coaches for them that are on foot. Nay, God forbid? I will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe my own horſe, or win another, and ſo ſaid the Knight of the Sphere. So they gave ſpurs to their horſes, and met together without breaking their Lances with ſuch force, that they were all foure thrown to the ground, but they ſoon a roſe and laying their hands on their Swords, there began a moſt cruell fight, ſo that fire came from their harneſſes, and blood from their bodies in ſuch manner, that the green graſſe changed colour, and they charged one another ſo long, that at length they had no armour wherewithall to defend themſelves: Wherefore they came to handie gripes, hoping by that meanes either to end their Combate or their lives: But there happened a dark cloud which wrapped them up in ſuch manner, that they could not be ſeen. And ſoon after the Sun did ſhine, and the four Combatants were ſeen without Helmets, the two ſons imbracing the two Fathers, <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and between them old <hi>Alquif,</hi> who ſaid to them, My Lords, it was not reaſonable that any of you foure ſhould have the honor of this Combate, for you are all of one fleſh. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> remembred that this was he that appeared to him on the day of Battell, when he reſcued his two Children. And <hi>Perion</hi> knew him having delivered him from the Giant in the Iſland that <hi>Alquefa</hi> had conducted him to. So ſoon as <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Liſvart</hi> had ſeen the fault they had committed to their fathers, they put their knees to the ground, and humbly intreated them to pardon them. Then Queen <hi>Madila,</hi> and the other vanquiſht Knights

Yet they were deceived, and knowing of the Duke the cauſe of their fathers ſtay, they lived in hopes.

When he heard himſelfe named he looked about, and through the brightneſſe of the Moon, he perceived a woman on the top of a tree, who ſaid to him, Unfortunate Knight, have a care that you put not your thoughts in execution, for God hath not given you theſe abilities to employ them in idleneſs. <hi>Liſvart</hi> was affrighted with this viſion, nevertheleſs he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to give credit thereunto, and therefore ſo ſoone as it was day, he took his ſheild, and mounting on his horſe travelled through the Foreſt, and marching forwards a Knight met him, who ſeeing <hi>Liſvart</hi> would follow him to ſee if he were fooliſh or mad; but he had not long accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him, before he heard him give a great ſigh crying, Alas Love, how ill haſt thou known my Loyaltie! at this word the other Knight advanced, and ſaid to him, Sir Knight I think you are in love. <hi>Liſvart</hi> caſted his eyes on him (who had not till then perceived him) and without anſwering him he would have departed: but the other ſtopped him, and took hold of his bridle, ſaying to him:

                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52725:84"/>By God ſir Knight you ſhall ſtay, will you or not? and I will know the cauſe of your fooliſhneſſe. How ſaid <hi>Liſvart?</hi> will you force me to a thing that doth not pleaſe me? Yes ſaid the other, for I never thought to finde a man ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as to be ſubject to a Sex ſo falſe, and malicious as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are. I wonder ſaid <hi>Liſvart,</hi> you have no reaſon to blame them, the leaſt whereof you are not worthy to ſerve. In good faith ſaid the Knight, you might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to have been a foole without being a Sott, as you are; now <hi>Liſvart</hi> being ſurprized with Choller ſuddenly laid hands on his Sword, and gave the Knight ſo great a blow on the hand, that he cut it off, and ſaid to him: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Raſcall, receive the Guerdon which thou deſerveſt for equalling thy ſelfe to her, who hath no ſecond. And as he thought to ſtrike him againe, the wounded Knight fled as faſt as he could, lamenting and crying pitifully. So <hi>Liſvart</hi> chaſed him not but followed his way. But he had not gone far, before he heard a voice behinde him crying, turne, turne thee. At this cry he looked back round about, and ſaw two Knights conducting the lame Knight, who ſaid to <hi>Liſvart:</hi> By God you ſhall now pay for your wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. Then they ſet on him, but he ſoone killed one of them, and had killed the other, but that ſix villaines came forth of the thickeſt of the wood, but he ſoone diſpatched foure of them, and the other did run away as alſo did the laſt Knight, who being provided did kill his fellowes horſes before he went, that <hi>Liſvart</hi> might not purſue him, <hi>Liſvarts</hi> owne horſe being killed before. Thus <hi>Liſvart</hi> was forced to travaile on foot, untill he came to a vallie (where was a pleaſant Fountaine ſhadowed by many ſpreading trees) where he ſtaid as well to reſt himſelfe from travell, as to drinke, he having not drunke ſince he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Then there came three Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, who ſeeing one in armour were afraid: but he called them, and they ſitting down by him, they gave him ſuch victualls as they had to eat. Then they left him, for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſleep. And as he was aſleep, he heard a voyce which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52725:84"/>called <hi>Liſvart:</hi> at this crie he lifted up his head, and ſaw a young childe neer him, and the child ſaid to him: <hi>Liſvart</hi> doe not deſpaire, and follow the Counſell that hath been given you this night: when you goe from hence goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the right hand, which will lead thee to the top of this Rock, where you ſhall finde a hermitage, and there you ſhall be provided with a convenient remedie; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ariſe. The childe, having ſaid thus, left <hi>Liſvart</hi> in great doubt from whence theſe viſions ſhould come, but at laſt he ſuppoſed that it was <hi>Alquif,</hi> or ſome from him. Therefore he gave credit to theſe ſpeeches, and went to the top of the Rock, and there in the houſe he found a black armour, and a writing in a Parchment, the contents whereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>

Then leaving the Hermitage, he went the way that he was directed, and found the barque whereinto he entred. And by reaſon that he was alone, he purpoſed to name himſelfe the ſolitary Knight, a name agreeable to his ſolitude. So he ſailed foure dayes and foure nights, and on the fifth he perceived a great Barque coming ſtrait towards him. In this Veſſell was foure Knights armed at all points, and a Damſell bound with great chaines. And when theſe two Veſſells joyned, he ſaw <hi>Alquefa,</hi> whom the ſoure Knights badly uſed: who being arived, cryed out to him: Sir Knight in the black armour, yeild your ſelfe to our mercy, and we will ſave your life: but they tarried not long before they had a cruell combate, where the Solitary Knight killed two of them in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52725:85"/>ſhort time, and the other two were forced to crave mercy, which he would not grant them untill he knew whether the Damſell would agree to it: who would not have him pardon them their lives unleſs it were upon condition, that they ſhould conduct her whither ſhe ſhould goe. And ſaid ſhe, they have hindred me from doing ſervice to two of the beſt Knights in the world, and whom if they know you, you may hereafter thanke for the good which I have had by your meanes. Sir ſaid the others to the Solitary Knight, we will doe whatſoever you pleaſe to command us, and we will ſware to performe it: the ſolitary Knight knew <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quifa,</hi> and he knew certainly that ſhe was returnd from <hi>Trebiſond</hi> to him and <hi>Perion,</hi> and therefore he ſaid to her, I pray you Damſell tell me, who are theſe ſo eſteemed Knights to whom you are going? ſir Knight anſwered ſhe, they are children to King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and the Emperour <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and for their ſakes I humbly pray you, that according to the promiſe which they haue made you, that they carrie me to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> truly Damſell, my friend ſaid the Solitary, they being the children of two ſuch Princes, as you have told me, I deſire greatly to ſerve them, and as for this voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I will and command theſe two Knights under faith that they obey you: having ſo ſaid, he commended her to the protection of God, and they being entred their Veſſells, <hi>Alquefa</hi> bethought her ſelf to aske his name, which he told her being calld the Solitary Knight? At this word the Barques ſevered, and that wherein <hi>Alquifa</hi> and the two Knights were, ſailed ſtraight to Coaſt: ſo the Solitary ſailed other five dayes without happening of any adventure, and continually thinking on the talke which he had with <hi>Alquefa,</hi> he thought that this meſſenger had brought him ſome pardon, for his immerited offence, but being much grieved, he ſailed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ſixth day, where he arived at the Iſle of Serpents.</p>

And there the Barque ſtaid of it ſelfe, then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his ſheild he landed, and travelled in a path that brought him to a Caſtle that was environed with water. He had not long travelled before he met with a Damſel, who acted the mad part, tearing her hair and crying moſt pitifully: wherefore he having pitie of her demanded the cauſe, which ſhe told him, that a Knight that was in the Caſtle had abuſed her, he then deſired her to conduct him to the place, and he would uſe his beſt abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to revenge her cauſe, but ſhe would not returne leaſt ſhe ſhould be worſe handled then before: wherefore he went himſelfe, and left her to attend his returne, ſo ſoone as he came neere to the Caſtle, he ſaw an old woman out of one of the windowes, who demanded of him what it was that he ſought, which he told her: wherefore ſhe told him that he might enter if he pleaſed: for the dore was open: wherefore he went to enter, but he had no ſooner ſet his foot on the bridge but he fell down into a Cave or dungeon, where he had like to have been killed with the fall: when he came to himſelfe he walked about, and found nothing but bones of men which he did tread on, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe encloſed with ſtrong walls, but at laſt he perceived an Iron dore, and he ſoon after eſpied a little window open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the old woman above who ſaid to him: Knight tell me now (ſeeing you are my priſoner) who you are. Ladie ſaid he, you have done me ſo ill a turne, that I will never obey you in any ſervice whatſoever. Then by my
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52725:86"/>faith ſaid ſhe, I will make you die the moſt cruell death that ever any man did. I fear not that ſaid the Solitary for death is common to all. It is true ſaid the old woman, then ſee what will happen: then ſhe did ſhut the window, but he could ſee by reaſon of the Carboncle which was at the handle of his ſword, as you have heard. She being departed, left him in ſuch choller, that he broke open the Iron dore, and thereby entred into another vault where he heard a great hiſſing, he having gone a little further met a great Serpent, having a head as big as an Oxes, and very large and long eares, then gnaſhing its teeth, it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the Solitary, who perceiving the perill he was in drew forth his Sword, and gave the Serpent ſuch a blow that he ſmote off one of its eares, wherewith the Serpent being enraged ran upon the Knight with open mouth, thinking to devoure him, but there was ſo much vertue in his ſword, that no venemous Creature could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them that carried it. wherefore the Solitary thruſt his ſword into the eare of the Serpent and ſo pearced its braines. The Serpent perceiving it ſelfe wounded to death, did unceſſantly caſt forth its ſcales and teeth with ſuch force, as if the ſtrongeh archers in the world had ſhot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes; but the Solitary did avoid all damage and hurt that might happen by them, by ſtanding behind the door that he had opened, and thus the beaſt continued, untill at length the ſword pearced ſo far its braine, that it fell down dead: wherefore the Solitary Knight fell down on his knees, and gave moſt devout thanks unto God, and then approached neer unto the beaſt, and drew forth his ſword with both his hands, ſetting his foot to the head of the beaſt. Then he broke open a dore, and ſo went up ſtaires, and in the end he came into the Court of the Caſtle, where he found ſome Knights with the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who did ſuppoſe him to be dead, but ſeeing him ſo neer them, and his ſword in his hand, they ran away as faſt as they could, and amongſt them there was the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that had betrayed him. Wherefore he ſaid to her,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52725:86"/>Wicked woman thou ſhalt never betray any more: ſaying ſo he purſued them, but he was ſtayed by ſome <hi>Halder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> who did defend the paſſage, but he in ſhort time kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome of them, and purſued the reſt who fled into a Hall, where he found a great Knight armed at all points, who ſaid to him: Infamous Raſcall (you ſhall repent the time that you entred into this Caſtle.) Ah wicked fellow ſaid the Solitary Knight art thou he who forceſt Damſells? At theſe words they charged one another, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate laſted ſo long between them, that in the end he of the Caſtle had the worſt, and loſt his life. Which they of the Caſtle ſeeing did all ſubmit themſelves unto him: then the old woman came who did make great lamentations for the death of the Knight, who was her ſon: but in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhe threw down the keyes of the Priſons, where her Priſoners were, and two of her ſervants went downe into the Priſons, and fetched them up who had been Priſoners there for the ſpace of eighteen years, and had not in all that time ſeen the day light. The Captives beeing come before him (and he having put off his Helmet) they fell down at his feet, and becauſe he did much reſemble his Grandfather <hi>Amadis,</hi> two of the Company took for <hi>Amadis,</hi> and ſaid to him: Ah Seigneur <hi>Amadis</hi> the ſuccour and aid of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate ones, you are arived here in very good time. My friends anſwered he, you are miſtaken, I am not <hi>Amadis,</hi> neither did I ever ſee him, Sir, ſaid one of them, I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that he is older, but I am confident that you are kin to him. And who are you ſaid the Solitary. I am ſaid he, <hi>Gastiles</hi> Nephew to the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and this other is <hi>Tartarie</hi> his Admirall. The Solitary Knight had formerly heard of them, but it was ſuppoſed that they had been dead twentie years before, wherefore he ſaid to them, my friend, I am very joyfull that I have delivered you out of priſon, for the ſake of the Emperour. And as they were thus diſcourſing, the old woman came, who having heard them talk of the Emperor, who was the man in the world that ſhe hated moſt, ſhe made a great complaint, however
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52725:87"/>ſaid ſhe, I will content my ſelfe, for the good and noble King <hi>Armato</hi> doth now beſiege <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and is ready to conquer it. In good faith Madam, anſwered the Solitary Knight, the Army of the King of whom you ſpeak hath been defeated, and he himſelfe is dead, and the reſt of his Army is fallen into the hands of this Emperour your great Enemy. Oh ye Gods (ſaid the old woman) what is this that I hear? I will not live after that moſt puiſſant King <hi>Armato:</hi> then ſhe took her ſons ſword, and ſet it to her breaſt, and fell thereon, and ſo ſell down dead. At which they all laughted, and that which encreaſed their laughter, they ſaw the Damſell (who cauſed the Solitary Knight to come to the Caſtle) come forth, and with great force throw her ſelf into the water, where ſhe was ſoon devoured by Crocodiles, and ſuch other gentle birds, who repaired thither. Then the Solitary demanded of one of them, what was this old womans name, and how ſhe came to take ſo many Knights, Sir anſwered he, ſhe was neice to the King <hi>Armato,</hi> and Ladie of this Iſle, called the Iſle of the Lake of Serpents, and ſo called for the great number of ſuch beaſts who are nouriſhed in this water, and from thence came this great Serpent who lies dead there, who did much damage unto this Country, untill our Lady by the meanes of her Aunt <hi>Melea</hi> found the meanes to encloſe the beaſt, where you found it.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſolved to land, and taking forth his horſe, hee took his Lance, Sheild and Helmet, and ſet forwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he heard a voice ſaying pitifully. Oh ſovereign God! How is it that you conſent that the beſt King and Queene in the world ſhould this day do ſo miſerably! at this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation he looked about, and ſaw a Lady richly clad, who was purſued by a great villaine, holding an Ax in his hand. But he ſtaid when he ſaw the ſolitary Knight, and asked of him which way the Lady was gone, for he had loſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52725:88"/>fight of her; why ſaid the Solitary, you would hurt her, I and you too. At this word the Solitary couched his Lance, and thruſting the villaine on the ſtomack, threw him down dead to the ground. Then he hearkned whether he could hear the Ladie, which he could not, neither could he finde her: wherefore he ſet forwards in the way that he had ſeen the villaine come, untill he arived at a very fair plaine, at the end whereof he found a Caſtle, ſeated upon a high Rock. And approaching ſomewhat neerer, he ſaw four Knights without armes, whom two Giants armed at all points, drew along by force into the Fortreſſe. Wherefore the Solitary had an extraordinary great deſire to know who they were, and riding a great gallop, he found a man unarmed at the foot of a Rock, who asked him if he were any of the Kings Company who was led Priſoner. No ſaid he, but I pray you tell me who it is. By my faith anſwered the other, I know no more but thus, that I have ſeen him and three other Knights roughly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with one of the faireſt Ladies that ever I ſaw, bound together with great Ropes, which doth much grieve me. The ſolitary Knight did deſire the man to guide him to the place that would bring him to the Caſtle, which he did, there being but one way, and that ſo ſtrait, that he was forced to leave his horſe behinde him, and he alſo forgot his Lance: when he came to the gate of the Caſtle, he ſtood ſtill to hear what he could, or till ſome body ſhould come forth. And he heard one of the Giants, who ſaid: King, thou art come in good time, for me to revenge the death of my brother. Then he heard another, who anſwered, Giant, if thon art a Knight deſiring renown, revenge the death of thy brother with honor, give me armes and then doe thy utmoſt. He having ſaid thus, he heard a Ladie make piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamentations. The ſolitary Knight not being able to endure any longer, knocked at the Gate, calling aloud to thoſe that are within. Then one of the Giants looked out of one of the towers, and asked him what he would have, and what he was. I am ſaid he a ſtrange Knight, who deſire
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52725:89"/>to ſee the King that is priſoner here, and therefore open me the Gate.

But he was deceived, for he ſoon found the contrary: for the Solitary behaved himſelfe ſo well, that he alſo vanquiſhed this other Giant, and entring into the Caſtle, he ſaw in the great Hall King <hi>Amadis, Oriana, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griole, D'Eſtrevaux, Sarquiles,</hi> and <hi>Gandalin</hi> tied by the necks with great cords, whereby he was much moved, and ran ſtrait to unbinde them, but the villaines of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had aſſembled together to aſſaile him, which he ſeeing, he firſt unbound <hi>Amadis,</hi> and then defended himſelf. <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Angriole</hi> with the reſt ſoon recovered weapons, and ſo behaved themſelves againſt the villaines of the Caſtle, that with the help of the Solitary, they ſoon ſlew above twentie of them, and the reſt came to mercy.

The Solitary having had this relation from her, left her, and departed, going to his barque, wherein he found the man that had taken his horſe, but he ſoon entred thereinto, and threw him into the Sea. Thus having the Giants ſheild inſtead of his owne that was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he departed, ſailing on the Sea in great griefe, for his Lady who had ſo baniſhed him her preſence, that he often times wiſhed to be dead.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S they were thus diſcourſing together about the enterpriſe of the Solitary, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man entred the Hall clad with garments of the cloth of Gold covered with pearls, and rich precious ſtones: he was faire and of a good ſtature. In this Company was twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Knights and as many Squires, and at his arivall making great reverence to King <hi>Amadis,</hi> he ſet his knee to the ground and kiſſed his hands. But the King graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, and asked him who he was. Sirs replied he, my name is <hi>Olorious</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and I am ſon to King <hi>Don Brian</hi> your ſingular good friend, who at my requeſt ſent me to you to reverence the order of Knighthood, which I humbly intreat of you to beſtow on me, being confident that I cannot receive this honor of a better hand then yours. <hi>Amadis</hi> underſtanding who he was, kindely wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed him, and preſented him to Queen <hi>Oriana,</hi> and the Empreſs <hi>Leonorina,</hi> ſaying to them: Ladies ſee the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Son, I pray make him welcome: he then hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaluted them, and a chaire being brought, the Queen cauſed him to ſit downe. And becauſe the Solitary and the Alman would retire, <hi>Amadis</hi> left him to diſcourſe with the Ladies, to give the good night to the two Knights, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the next day of Pentecoſt they came to the Court, it being late and their Helmets on their heads, becauſe they would not be diſcovered; and they found the Princeſs of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> and King <hi>Norandells</hi> Son richly armed with white armes, as it was the cuſtome for new Knights. Thus they were conducted to the Church to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52725:106"/>watch whither they were attended by the Empreſs, the Queens <hi>Oriana,</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of <hi>Sardaigne,</hi> the <hi>Infanta Briſenna,</hi> and other Ladies and Damſells, who left them there untill the next morning: when <hi>Amadis</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the two unknown Knights, and many other great Lords, Ladies and Damſells went to them. Then he gave them the Order, and <hi>Oriana</hi> girded on the Sword of <hi>Olori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the Empreſs Prince <hi>Elinie's,</hi> and the <hi>Infanta Briſenna Adariells.</hi> Then ſoon after the Maſſe was ſolemnly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and from thence they went to the Palace, where the great Hall was hung with much rich Tapeſtrie, which the deceaſed King <hi>Liſvart</hi> had cauſed to be made in his time: in the one whereof was deſcribed the Combate of <hi>Amadis</hi> againſt <hi>Ardan Canile,</hi> in the others that of the <hi>Endragus,</hi> the triall of the Arke of Loyall Lovers, the Defended Chamber, the proofe of the Sword, and the Scarfe with flowers, the cruell battell of one hundred to one hundred betwen King <hi>Liſvart</hi> and <hi>Cildadan</hi> at that time, that <hi>Amadis</hi> loſt the name of the faire forlorne, and likewiſe how he vanquiſhed the two ſtrong Giants <hi>Famongornad</hi> and his ſon <hi>Barſigant,</hi> who carried the <hi>Infanta Leonor</hi> Priſoner. But the Solitary and the Alman returned to their Tent, where the <hi>Infanta Briſenna</hi> ſent them horſes and all manner of other proviſions, as Cloth of Gold to cover their Sheilds, with which they all did, and ſo taking their Lances they went unto the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Tournie, whether ſoon after came King <hi>Amadis</hi> accompanied with moſt of the Lords and Ladies of the Court; they had not ſtaid there long before they ſaw ſix Knights very well armed, and mounted, who came out of the Forreſt; foure whereof retired, and the other two (having touched the two Sheilds that were placed on the pillars) prepared themſelves for the Encounter, which they preſently performed ſo, that their Lances broke into ſhivers, and they were forced to meaſure their lengths on the ground: which Fortune likewiſe happened to the other four onely, the two laſt ran twice before they left their
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52725:107"/>horſes. Then there came thoſe who were ordained for the keeping of the Tourney to know their names: but before they arived they had pulled off their Helmets: ſo that they ſaw the two firſt to be <hi>Teluis</hi> the Flemming, and <hi>Yrguian</hi> ſon of <hi>Gandalin,</hi> the two others <hi>Dragonis</hi> and <hi>Balonir,</hi> and the others <hi>Garnate</hi> of the Dreadfull dale, and <hi>Ambor</hi> of <hi>Gandell</hi> ſon to <hi>Angriole D'Eſtrevaux.</hi> Soon after the <hi>Infanta Briſenna</hi> ſent the names of the vanquiſhed Knights accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the agreement, and ſoon after that fourteen Knights were ſeen to come out of the wood, and a little while after ten others, who came all to touch the ſheilds; but the two Knights rewarded them all ſo well, that he ſoon made them all meaſure their lengths on the ground. Thus theſe two Knights (after they had done with theſe) remained readie to aſſaile or defend as occaſion ſhould happen, untill it grew dark: and therefore the King <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> with all his traine departed to ſupper, where all their diſcourſe was about theſe two valiant and victorious Knights.</p>

A little before evening there iſſued out of the Foreſt a Knight in green Armor, who by his armes was known not to have been idle: for they were ſo battered and broken, that he ſcarce had any thing wherewithall to defend himſelfe: he having made a great reverence to the King and Ladies touched the ſheild, and preſently the Alman ran againſt him, and at the firſt courſe their Lances flew into ſhivers; but at the ſecond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Alman was thrown from his horſe, and the Green Knight remained unmoved in his ſaddle: at which adventure all the aſſembly greatly wondred, and <hi>Amadis</hi> ſuſpected that it was <hi>Eſplandian:</hi> yet he held not this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on long, but armed himſelfe ſo faſt as he could; for his minde gave him that he ſhould be forced to incounter with the green Knight.

My friend ſaid <hi>Onolorea,</hi> will it not ſuffice you that I am yours, and content your ſelfe with the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, which is the proper fruit of Lovers, without deſiring a pleaſure which is ſo ſoon paſſed, and which brings (as is ſaid) nothing but ſadneſs. But ſo much the more ſhe prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered theſe excuſes, the leſs ſhe perſwaded <hi>Liſvart</hi> to give credit to her, but letting looſe the bridle to his paſſions; he cropt the firſt flower of her Roſe, which was found to be a thorne. In this time <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Gricilerea</hi> did their work at leaſure. I know not, if they had ſuch Covenants, it is very true that the end of the ſport turned to promiſes and oathes to returne on other nights to the ſame place, a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo happie ſport: in which they exerciſed themſelves a week together, without being perceived or diſcovered, no, not by <hi>Alquefa,</hi> although ſhe knew of moſt of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affaires: but of this ſhe was ignorant.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Emperor (being a moſt affable Prince, not knowing what pleaſure to give to the three Knights who had been lately healed of their wounds) purpoſed one day to goe hunt in the adjoyning Foreſt, and therefore he ſent his hunters to make preparations. And as they were in the heat of their ſport, the Emperor and <hi>Perion</hi> being together, there came forth a Bear, which they purſed ſo much that they killd it, and they heard a moſt dolorous voyce towards the ſea-ſide: wherefore they advanced thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wards, and there they ſaw a Damſell pitifully lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a Knight lay by her dead, and doe <hi>Perion</hi> and the Emperor what they could, they could not cauſe her to leave her lamentations: then they were very deſirous to know her misfortune: alas ſir Enight anſwered ſhe, let me alone, or promiſe me one gift, and I will recount unto you what you deſire to know. <hi>Perion</hi> being ready to promiſe ſoone agreed to her: Then ſeeing it ſo ſaid ſhe, arme your ſelfe with the Armes of this dead Knight who is my Father, and follow me unto an Iſland foure miles from hence, where the Raſcal that killed my Father promiſed to ſtay, untill I bring one to fight with him. <hi>Perion</hi> being willing to purſue this enterpriſe armed himſelfe, and entred into a Barque that was there adjoyning, and the Emperor went along with him to bear him Company. Then the Damſell made ſuch ſpeed, that they ſoon loſt ſight of land. We will leave them hear untill another time, and returne to the others who hunted in the Foreſt, who having much veniſon, and ſeeing the night approach uſed great diligence to finde the Emperor
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52725:124"/>and <hi>Perion.</hi> Yet they could hear no tidings of them; but a certaine foot-boy told them that he had ſeen them purſue a Bear, and he ſhewed them the way that they went, where they found the beaſt dead: but they could hear no tidings of the Emperor nor <hi>Perion,</hi> but onely they found their horſes unbride<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No anſwered they, unleſs it be one. <hi>Olorius</hi> was preſent, who earneſtly entreated <hi>Liſvart</hi> to let him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, which he granted him: in ſuch manner, that they two being entred into the Barque, we will leave the King of <hi>Breigne,</hi> and the reſt on the land.</p>

Then they three iſſued out of the Barque, and ſoone after the Knight aduanced, who asked of them whether they went, and what they ſearched for. Knight anſwered <hi>Perion,</hi> you have promiſed this Damſel to ſtay here, untill ſhe ſhould bring a Gentleman to fight with you, and revenge the death of her Father, whom you have murthered. And well ſaid the other, what of that? nothing ſaid <hi>Perion,</hi> but I will onely have your life in recompence of his. In good faith ſaid the Knight, your enterpriſe is folly, and I will chaſtiſe you before you eſcape my hands. Having ſaid thus he laid hands on his ſword, and <hi>Perion</hi> did ſo likewiſe: when holding forth his ſheild to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe from the blow of his enemy, his ſheild was cut in twaine, and he ſtriking the Knight one blow his ſword broke in three pieces.

Then the old woman knowing the Emperour ſaid to him: Wicked Emperor, ſeeing that you are now in my power, I will make you an example to all others, who goe about to hurt the friends of <hi>Armato,</hi> and now I will revenge the death of him, and many other great Lords which you were the cauſe of.

Then he knew that there was treaſon: for they ſoon put great Irons on his legs, which grieved him to the heart, and as he ſtoopt he gave one of the Villaines ſuch a blow on the mouth, that he broke out four of his teeth. In the mean time the cries of the Damſell came to the ears of <hi>Olorius,</hi> who was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with the other, and he went towards the Pavillion to ſee what was the matter.

Then he ſaw well that he could no longer reſiſt: for he was encompaſſed ſo on all ſides, that he was taken and bound as the others were, who were carried neer the Sea, and there they were ſeparated, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers Veſſells, without knowing whither they were carried, nor wherefore they were ſo illy handled.</p>
